{"article": "###\nArticle: Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation. Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "There is a \"chronic\" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: \"Where was your sense of decency?\" Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor. Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune. The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt. In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump. The victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Restoring the function of the organ - which helps control blood sugar levels - reversed symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments. The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\" There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Dr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes. \"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\" BBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo. He said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs). \"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight. \"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\" His blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers. He said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\" Peter Bowes: Fasting for science Peter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body Separate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why. However, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet. He told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\" He said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance. Dr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes. \"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\" Follow James on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The pancreas can be triggered to regenerate itself through a type of fasting diet, say US researchers.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: But there certainly should be. These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer. It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is. \"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor. But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry. Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user. \"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them. \"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds. If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry. It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. \"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues. In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. \"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\". Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review. These are: An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. \"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said. \"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. \"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says. \"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\" If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros. For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros. With cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device The Olympic silver medallist accused the organisation of \"ageism\" and having \"zero regard\" for her welfare. She is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme. Houvenaghel told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures. The report said British Cycling \"sanitised\" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment. British Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview. Both Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling. Houvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture. A government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently. It is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies. Houvenaghel claimed: British Cycling said it \"has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme\". It said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to \"systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings\". The statement added: \"Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling.\" Who else has spoken out? Houvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011. She retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury. Houvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time. Speaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was \"very traumatic\" and she felt \"torment\" at having \"no explanation\" for her last-minute omission. At the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to \"take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional\". He added: \"I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that.\" British Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was \"proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career\" and she was \"part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence\", but was dropped in London 2012 \"based on her performance\". Other elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling. Asked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: \"It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race. \"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities. \"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative. \"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\" Houvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age. \"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012. \"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them. \"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\" Fourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying. Asked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals. \"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through. \"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A \"medal at any cost\" approach created a \"culture of fear\" at British Cycling, says former rider Wendy Houvenaghel.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (\u00c2\u00a313,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease. \"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr. \"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\" Three years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club. Mr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers. And he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space. Mr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient. \"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\" Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US. An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020. \"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr. \"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\" While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age. \"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says. \"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\" Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news. \"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\" But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person. \"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield. \"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge. \"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics. The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\" Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year. Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons. He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring. And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income. Mr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at. \"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500. \"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\" Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks. \"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh? \"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\" While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost. \"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says. \"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it. \"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\" But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh. Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September. He says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'. \"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet. \"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Relieved that the giant telecoms company would not be broken up, they piled into the shares, sending them up 3% in early trading. BT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons. She said complications with land deals and BT's giant pension scheme meant there were \"practical obstacles\" to a break-up that would delay the process several years. It's the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom's thinking. BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about \u00c2\u00a340bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about \u00c2\u00a310bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap. Senior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off. Separating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won. Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband. BT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners. This holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king. It also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards. BT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles. If they prove too much at odds with BT's own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The reaction from BT's investors told us much about media regulator Ofcom's ruling on the fate of Openreach, the BT subsidiary that provides much of the UK's broadband infrastructure.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The move is in response to an \u00a38m cut in the subsidy received from the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL). The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015. Job losses will be among both academic and non-academic staff and Queen's says no compulsory redundancies should be required. There are currently around 17,000 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at the university, and around 3,800 staff. Queen's has a current intake of around 4,500 undergraduates per year. The university aims to reduce the number of student places by 1,010 over the next three years. The BBC understands that there are no immediate plans to close departments or courses, but that the cuts in funding may put some departments and courses at risk. The Education Minister Stephen Farry said he recognised that some students might now choose to study in other areas of the UK because of the cuts facing Northern Ireland's universities. \"Some people will now be forced to look to opportunities in other parts of Great Britain and may not return to our economy,\" he said. \"Defunding our investment in skills, particularly at a time when we're trying to grow the economy does not make a lot of sense. What's happening is we're going backwards. \"The loss of any place is damaging to our economy, all subjects teach our young people critical skills.\" Queen's vice-chancellor Patrick Johnston said the cuts had the potential to damage the reputation of the university. \"The potential negative impact, not just on the university but on the local economy is very significant,\" he said. \"It's the last thing we want to do, but we have to begin to focus on those areas where we can grow the organisation and develop it - it's clear we can no longer depend on the public purse to fund tuition. \"If we're not competitive we will not attract the best students, and we will not attract the best staff.\" Just under \u00a3100m, a third of the university's income, comes from the Northern Ireland Executive. DEL's budget was reduced by \u00a362m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from \u00a3203m to \u00a3186m, a reduction of 8.2%.

Ten shadow ministers were among 47 Labour MPs who rejected party orders to back it last week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said frontbenchers would have to quit if they defied the whip at the next vote. The draft legislation comes back to the Commons on Monday for three days of debate culminating in a vote on its third reading. Speaking on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry rejected a suggestion the party was \"hopelessly divided\" on the issue. She said she understood colleagues not wanting to vote in favour of invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the formal departure process, but said: \"We have said that we will not frustrate Brexit. We have got our instructions from the British people. We are democrats and the public have voted to leave the European Union.\" Labour will try to amend the draft legislation to secure what it calls a \"meaningful vote\" on the final deal struck between Theresa May and the EU, and to guarantee the status of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living elsewhere in Europe. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as \"red lines\". Ms Thornberry declined to say whether they were non-negotiable red lines for her party, and denied it was \"illogical\" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected. \"There will need to be back channels, private conversations. There are many conversations going on now,\" she said. \"We are speaking to government, we are speaking to Tory backbenchers and we are trying to get a compromise that will work.\" One of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, missed Wednesday's vote, citing illness. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint criticised Ms Abbott, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday: \"We used to have man flu, we now have Brexit flu that Diane has created here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it's about being part of a team. \"I think she holds one of the most important portfolios within a shadow cabinet. If she can't support the leader on this then she should go.\" But former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman defended Ms Abbott, pointing out she had earlier said on television she would back the bill so had \"already taken the flak on it\". Among the rebels in last week's second reading vote were 10 members of the front bench, who would ordinarily be expected to step down after defying leadership instructions to back the bill. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that changes to his shadow cabinet would be announced \"in the coming few days\". Asked if he should be lenient, he added: \"I'm a very lenient person.\" Speaking later, he said he expected Ms Abbott to vote with the party this week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the shadow cabinet would decide how to approach Wednesday's third reading vote on the Brexit bill. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live that if a three-line whip was again imposed, any frontbenchers who rebelled \"will have to step down\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The shadow foreign secretary has suggested Labour will continue to support legislation paving the way for Brexit as it passes through Parliament.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Dr Waleed Abdalati told the BBC the that continued access to data is in \"everyone's best interest\". Many US scientists are rushing to copy information onto servers outside the control of the federal government. They are afraid the Trump administration will curb access to climate and other research. The President-elect has blown hot and cold on the issue of climate change, having previously tweeted about global warming being a hoax. On Wednesday, one of his advisers compared scientists who support the mainstream view on global warming to flat-Earthers. \"There was an overwhelming science that the Earth was flat and there was an overwhelming science that we were the centre of the world,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the Trump transition committee, on CNN. \"We get a lot of things wrong in the scientific community.\" Now at the Co-operative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Dr Abdalati served as Nasa's chief scientist in 2011, for two years. He says it is too early to tell if this type of rhetoric from the Trump team will be backed up by action against scientists working on climate issues. \"I do think that when it comes to access to federal databases, and information that the taxpayers have paid for, there would have to be a tremendous paradigm shift to actively take steps to make those data unavailable, and I think doing so would be an enormous disservice to the citizens of this country and to the world in general,\" he said via email. \"I do think that the scientific community, educators, members of the private sector who rely on these data in their businesses, and others will need to make clear that continued access to these data, which have been paid for by the taxpayers, allows their full value to be realized and is in everyone's best interest.\" Other researchers are taking a more pessimistic view on the question of data access and are encouraging colleagues and students to make copies. Prof Robert Paterson, from the University of Texas, Austin, says that he learned this the hard way under the administration of George W Bush, another president cool on climate. \"Within a month of coming into office the EPA website went down for three weeks and when it went back up stuff wasn't available anymore,\" Prof Paterson told BBC News. \"If history repeats itself with another administration that is basically a naysayer to climate change science, I would say it would be prudent for folks to do what they can to keep as much as they can on mirror sites.\" Other scientists are concerned about nominations to key government areas such as former Texas governor Rick Perry at Department of Energy (DoE) and Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt at the EPA. Both have heavily criticised the agencies they now lead. Attempts by the Trump transition team at the DoE to obtain a list of all those employees who had worked on climate change have provoked anger as well as fear. \"I was horrified by the report with regard to Department of Energy scientists being named.  We must stand up to that and I have said so. We are all DoE scientists in that regard,\" said Dr Kevin Trenberth who has been a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). \"That is a pretty chilling action by an incoming administration - the rhetoric suggests that revenge is a valid response to people who disagree with you,\" said Prof Robert Paterson, The Energy department has refused to comply with the request and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was \"not authorised\". Many researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations. \"Flooding is a fact of life in Texas and the frequency with which we're seeing it is noticeably increasing,\" said Dr Shannon Van Zandt, at Texas A&M University. \"A lot of the tools that have been developed by Federal agencies have been designed to help communities predict the changes that they're going to see and if that is restricted we would lose the ability to help people understand and incorporate it into the decisions that they're making both at the local level and at the state policy level.\" But some in this field believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking. Marcel Crok is a Dutch science writer who doesn't support the scientific consensus on climate change. He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this. Mr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise. Mainstream scientists, he says, rely on models that are over sensitive to carbon. He expects this to change under Trump. He said: \"What the field is trying to do is prove that the observational estimates are wrong and that the models are still right, and in my opinion this is exactly the problem. They should be more open minded, they should be open to the idea that the models are wrong!\" \"I hope that under a Trump regime at least there would be more funding, because if the funding agencies ask these kind of questions they can stimulate research in other directions than proving that the models are right all the time.\" The idea that aspects of climate research, supported by a minority, should now gain funding at the expense of the majority view, is dismissed by those in the field. \"It is not all spun, it is not all one side or the other,\" said Prof James White from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. \"This is good unbiased information, it would be a real shame if that data is turned off.\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Limiting access to federal research would do an \"enormous disservice\" to the US and the world according to former Nasa chief scientist.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also said there were \"significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls.\" But the regulator said the fine took into account the bank's speedy action in alerting the authorities once it had discovered the illegal trades, which took place in its emerging markets rates business in 2011. \"This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today's sanctions are not heavier ones,\" Mark Steward, the SFC's head of enforcement, said in a statement.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Here are the best bits we heard backstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In La La Land, Emma Stone plays aspiring actress Mia Dolan. So does the best actress winner think Mia could ever win a Bafta or Oscar? After a dramatic pause, she delivered her verdict. \"Hopefully!\" \"It's been like a whirlwind,\" said Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, winner of the Rising Star Award. \"I'm so happy everything seems to be working out.\" The 20-year-old Brit isn't wrong there. Having made his screen debut in tsunami disaster movie The Impossible, he first appeared as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War and recently finished filming for Spider-Man: Homecoming. But Tom admitted the super hero role has its drawbacks. \"Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to be Spider-Man. It's been so fun, but my legs are in bits right now from spider poses after spider poses. \"So I'll be sitting down for the rest of the evening!\" It was perhaps inevitable that Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes would come up at the Baftas. Asked about Donald Trump's response, supporting actress winner Viola Davis didn't hold back. \"Anyone who labels Meryl Streep an 'overrated' actress obviously doesn't know anything about acting,\" she said. \"That's not just directed towards Donald Trump - that's directed towards anyone.\" She didn't stop there. \"This is someone who is the master at her skill and she has lasted for 40 years in a very difficult profession,\" Viola continued. \"One of the things people have to know about this woman is that she is the most honourable, accessible human being you could possibly want to meet.\" Best actor winner Casey Affleck said he'd grabbed a word with Meryl Streep after the Baftas ceremony. \"She was taking pictures of people... and I told her how much her speech at the Golden Globes meant to all of us and how grateful I was that she did it and kicked in the door a little bit,\" he said. The Manchester by the Sea star said he hoped more actors would speak out. \"There is a big audience for these awards shows... and I have to say I'm very proud to be a part of the arts community. \"I don't always say some of the things I would like to say in those opportunities because there are people like Meryl Streep who say them much better than I can - and if they are going to be said it should be said very, very well because they are important.\" \"I'm a little bit wobbly,\" confessed Dev Patel a few minutes after winning the supporting actor prize for Lion. \"I really did not expect it, we have gone to so many awards ceremony and this one is where everything changed, on home turf with my family.\" Dev recalled how he had made his acting debut a decade ago on E4's teen drama Skins. \"I remember the first time I ever stepped on a film set, I never knew what a boom mic was,\" he laughed. \"My mum took me to an open casting of Skins after she saw an advert in Metro newspaper and 10 years on we are here at the Baftas - that is pretty amazing.\" Justin Hurwitz, who won the Bafta for his original music in La La Land, said that he'd written a title song that didn't end up in the movie. \"It was going to be in the middle of the movie but we nixed that, and then we toyed with using it in the end credits, and we nixed that at the last minute.\" And how about this? Another Day of Sun, from the famous traffic jam scene, was cut \"for many months\" before being put back in as the big opening number. Mel Brooks, who was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, was asked about whether he might write a comedy about Donald Trump. \"I'm not afraid of him, I don't think he's dangerous,\" said the 90-year-old writer, actor and producer. \"I think he's mostly an entertainer, a guy who wants audiences to love him. \"What I'm afraid of are all the guys around him, the people who whisper in his ears, like the people who whispered in George W Bush's ears and we got the Iraq War... \"I just hope that Trump stays the egomaniac he is, listens to no-one and then we'll all be safe.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device Of his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine. Winning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable. And yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price. Murray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern. Opting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer? Although it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell. Media playback is not supported on this device Murray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets. As well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells. Though he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open. So, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon. Murray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final. It would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years. Yet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field. He has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way. This year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%. He claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden. But perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter. That may not be a concern much longer. Murray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest. In fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further. Nadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further. And then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Manor's operating company Just Racing Services has been in administration since 6 January, and FRP Advisory has been unable to find a buyer. Just Racing ceased trading on Friday, effectively ending the Manor team. The staff were sent home on Friday and told they will be made redundant by the close of business on Tuesday after the payment of January salaries. FRP said there was \"no sustainable operational or financial structure in place to maintain the group as a going concern\". Joint administrator Geoff Rowley added the administration process \"provided a moratorium\" in the search for a buyer but \"no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form\". It is not necessarily the end of Manor - a buyer could potentially still purchase the remnants of the team. But even if that were to happen, the move makes it much harder for Manor to make it to the start of the season in Australia on 26 March. The team's collapse leaves 10 teams - 20 cars - on the grid in Melbourne and comes just five days after the sport was taken over by US company Liberty Media and long-time commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone was removed as chief executive. Media playback is not supported on this device Manor started life as Virgin Racing in 2010 and has been through several guises in the intervening seven years. It previously went into administration in October 2014, and was only saved by current owner Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of energy firm Ovo, on the eve of the 2015 season. Fitzpatrick has said the decisive moment was the team's slip to 11th place in the constructors' championship as a result of Sauber's Felipe Nasr finishing ninth in the penultimate race of last season in Brazil. This cost the team in the region of $15m (\u00a312m) in prize money. Manor were one of three new teams to enter F1 in 2010 after they were promised by then FIA president Max Mosley that a \u00a340m budget cap would be introduced. But Mosley stood down as head of the governing body in 2009 after losing a fight with the teams over the plan and the cost limit was abandoned. All three teams have now collapsed. This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser Anneliese Dodds MEP has called for a European Commission investigation into the FIA and F1 following Manor's collapse.

I am very concerned that this follows other job losses in small teams. \"Formula One Group, its owners and the FIA as a regulator really need to be investigated after this collapse. \"The unfair way in which prize money is allocated in the sport, permanently favouring the largest teams regardless of their finishing position, has seen many teams struggle to survive and ultimately reduced the number of cars on the grid. \"The European Commission must investigate the complaints it received last year from two F1 teams related to anti-competitive practices before even more highly skilled jobs are lost both in the South East and all around Europe. \"I will be writing to the Commission to call on them to take serious action on the way F1 is run, before a sport loved by 500 million fans is damaged beyond repair.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The Manor team have collapsed after administrators failed to find a buyer for the stricken business.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The suspect appeared at the Old Bailey accused of failing to contact a monitoring company and report to a police station twice in January. The Home Office has refused to comment on the case. TPims replaced control orders in January 2012. The suspect - who can only be referred to as BM - was one of nine British citizens subject to a TPim when the figures were last disclosed in March. The BBC is not aware of anyone else who has appeared in court charged with a breach of a TPim. The Home Office said: \"We do not comment on individual cases.  The police investigate all breaches of TPims and will prosecute where that is viable.\" Those subject to a TPim can be ordered to stay overnight at a specified address and report to a police station every day. Other measures include a ban on contacting particular individuals, going to certain areas and places and travelling abroad. Labour has argued that TPims have \"weakened\" public protection against terrorism. In March, the independent reviewer of terror laws, David Anderson, said TPims could prove less effective than control orders because they can be imposed for a maximum period of two years only. The court heard that BM is charged with two counts of breaching Section 23 of a TPim order. The allegations are that on 16 January he failed to contact a monitoring company, and on 27 January failed to report to a police station. BM, who has a grey beard and was dressed for the hearing in a white shirt, cannot be named nor have his address published for legal reasons.

Directed by Sir Kenneth Branagh, Cinderella is a live-action version of Disney's classic 1950 animation that has taken $70m (\u00c2\u00a343.1m) on its opening weekend in the United States. Yet this adaptation is completely faithful to the traditional story - including wicked stepmother, fairy godmother, glass slipper, handsome prince and happy ending. British actress Lily James, best known as Lady Rose from ITV's Downton Abbey, stars as Cinderella. Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother. \"Keeping it classic is the twist,\" says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V. \"I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015. \"I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price. \"In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think. \"Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work.\" Helena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious \"as to whether a straight version would work\". \"I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying: 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?' \"It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role.\" Just as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that \"while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm\". But James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella \"is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her\". \"This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother. \"She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone.\" This is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. \"Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss,\" she says. \"I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name. \"I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella.\" James has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as \"irrelevant\", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her \"morals\". Cate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is \"kindness\", adding that it is \"an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength. \"There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming.\" Branagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness \"as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it. \"People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters; great cruelty and great kindness. \"This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature. \"And regardless of what happens to this film version, I believe this is why the tale of Cinderella will keep enduring.\" Cinderella is out in the UK on 27 March.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "In recent years, Hollywood remakes and re-imaginings of classic fairytales have come thick and fast - all darker, more adult versions of tales that originally appeared in cinemas.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: But one nation, Russia, was missing. For the first time in Eurovision history, the host nation barred another country's singer. That is because in 2015, in violation of Ukrainian border rules, Russia's Julia Samoilova performed in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia a year earlier. Samoilova suffers from a neural muscular disorder and has used a wheelchair since childhood. \"When the rumours began I might not go, I was so sad,\" she told the BBC in Moscow. \"I thought, how come? This was my dream. When the final decision was taken I didn't believe it. But unfortunately, this is the reality.\" \"I think it's a stupid reaction,\" Russian MP Vitaly Milonov tells me. \"They're even afraid of such a small girl to enter Kiev.\" Even before Ukraine's ban, Mr Milonov had called for a Russian boycott of Eurovision: \"Eurovision became a disgusting socialist nightmare for all these left-wing parties with all their bearded women, or men, with these anti-Christian positions. \"I am sure that most conservatives in the world will never attend this festival. Because this is a festival of Sodom and Gomorrah.\" It is supposed to be a festival of peace and friendship but there is not much sign of either in relations between Kiev and Moscow. In eastern Ukraine, 10,000 people have been killed in three years of war: a war in which Russia is directly involved through its military support for separatist rebels. Crimea remains a source of tension and Eurovision is the latest battleground. \"Since 2014, we've had a law in Ukraine that punishes people who illegally cross our border when they visit Crimea,\" says Ukrainian MP Olha Chervakova. \"Did Russia know this? Of course. Did Russia know that Julia Samoilova would fall foul of this law? Of course. In other words, entering her in the contest was a conscious provocation to create a huge political scandal.\" The ban created a huge headache for Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Eurovision's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said in March that Ukraine's decision went \"against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values\". In an unprecedented move, the EBU offered Russia the chance to take part by satellite from Moscow. Russia declined: after the dramas of last year's Eurovision, Moscow was in no mood to compromise. Ukraine's 2016 winning entry, 1944, sung by Jamala, was about Joseph Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population. Russia had argued that Jamala's song broke contest rules for being of a political nature. When it won, Moscow cried foul and said there was politics at play. Now Russia seems determined to make not only Ukraine look bad, but the entire Eurovision Song Contest. When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you and say 'we're not guilty' Recently, two Russian pranksters - posing as Ukraine's prime minister and his assistant - released online a telephone conversation they had recorded with a woman they claimed was EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre. If this is the voice of the EBU's top official, it is hugely embarrassing for the EBU, because the woman on the recording makes an astonishing admission about Ukraine's winning song: \"I was just too late made aware of the song. \"If I would have been earlier, and I think it was on purpose, I would have not allowed the song to participate, to be very transparent.\" In a statement, the EBU said it would \"not comment on prank calls\". But these are high-profile Russian pranksters, who once fooled Elton John into thinking he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Now our people don't trust Eurovision any more,\" one of the pranksters, Alexei, told me. \"People understand that any country can use their political goals to win, so it's not a fair contest anymore.\" Perhaps this is not just about a song contest? Or Russia's relations with Ukraine? Equating Eurovision with Sodom and Gomorrah and embarrassing the EBU appear part of a wider pattern of Russia trying to undermine Western institutions and Western liberal ideas. \"Russia now defines itself in its social and societal model against the West,\" believes Jan Techau of the Richard Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. \"The Kremlin explicitly portrays Russian society as a counter model to the corrupted West. They seem now to buy completely into the idea that whatever harms the West is good for Russia: a classic zero-sum game.\" In the run-up to this year's contest, singer Jamala warned that \"we should expect more provocations [from Russia] because our victory hurt them a lot.\" Security in Kiev is tight ahead of the first semi-final. As for Julia Samoilova, instead of singing at Eurovision this week, she will be performing - once again - in Crimea.

The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches. \"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times. \"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there. \"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them. \"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them. \"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool. \"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff. \"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous. \"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage. \"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern. \"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose. \"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them. \"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work. \"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again. \"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them. \"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal. \"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me.\" Alex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs.

{"article": "###\nArticle: About 47% of working South Africans earn less than the wage, which is being introduced to combat income poverty and inequality. But critics say it could put more people out of work as employers might not be able to afford the higher wages. The government says it will consult on the issue, but hopes to introduce a minimum wage within two years. Announcing the rate, which was proposed by a panel of advisers, the country's deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa said: \"We are now a step closer to finalising discussions on the national minimum wage. All social partners will now decide what their take is.\" He said the panel was not endorsing the proposed figure as a living wage, but wanted to set a minimum payment for workers. Wages are politically sensitive in the country, where the official unemployment rate is close to 25%. One employment expert reckoned the figure was only about a quarter of the amount needed for the upkeep of a typical South African working-class household. Prof Chris Malikane of the University of Witwatersrand told a Johannesburg radio station: \"You would need 12,000 rand to sustain a basic household.\" The African National Congress, South Africa's ruling party, supported the proposal calling it \"credible and clearly supported by clear evidence\". However, the Economic Freedom Fighters, the country's third largest political party, said the plan \"favours business at the expense of workers\". It called for a higher minimum wage of at least 4,500 rand. South Africa faces a possible downgrade to sub-investment grade by credit ratings agencies next month, with concerns remaining over violent wage strikes. Moody's currently rates South Africa two notches above subinvestment grade, with a negative outlook, while Fitch and S&P Global Ratings have it just a step above \"junk\".

{"article": "###\nArticle: Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration. Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame. A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught. To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over. But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore. The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma. Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism. Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime. He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship. His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia. His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order. Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring. The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele. But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty. The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress\", has long stalled. Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents. Why West will miss Meles Obituary: Meles Zenawi Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time. Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival. He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents. His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising. That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus. The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up. Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically. He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums. He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable. Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse. From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought. Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders. The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests. He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991. The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea. Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border. It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension. That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond. In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia. The death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia. There are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview. Such fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility. However, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has thrown the populous Horn of Africa giant into a period of deep uncertainty and created a serious leadership vacuum in the region with profound geopolitical implications.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Russian air force would continue its support of the Syrian armed forces. He also urged Washington to deliver on a pledge to separate moderate Syrian opposition fighters from \"terrorists\". US Secretary of State John Kerry warned the US was \"on the verge\" of suspending talks with Russia over Syria. \"It's irrational, in the context of the kind of bombing taking place, to be sitting there, trying to take things seriously,\" he told a conference in Washington. \"There is no notion or indication of seriousness of purpose with what is taking place right now.\" The Russian foreign ministry said a US refusal to co-operate would be a gift to \"terrorists\". The US and Russia have been negotiating for months to try to secure a cessation of hostilities but the latest truce collapsed last week after only a few days and attacks on eastern Aleppo have since intensified. The US warned on Wednesday it would end talks on military co-operation unless Moscow stopped the bombing. The recent cessation deal was meant to lead to joint Russian-US air strikes on so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front). However Russia has complained the US has not done enough to separate the more moderate rebel groups, which it backs, from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Many of these groups have formed a strategic alliance with the more powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and fight alongside it. Despite growing tensions between the two nations, Mr Peskov said Russia remains interested in pursuing talks with the US in an effort to resolve the crisis in Syria. His comments echo a statement from Moscow, which insisted it would send diplomats to Geneva to discuss ways of normalising the situation with the US. US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that national security agencies were reviewing all options to try to end the Syrian civil war. He said President Barack Obama had asked \"all of the agencies to put forward options, some familiar, some new, that we are very actively reviewing\". \"When we are able to work through these in the days ahead we'll have an opportunity to come back and talk about them in detail,\" he said.

Mr O'Brien, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the UN Security Council Aleppo had descended into a \"merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe unlike any we have witnessed in Syria\".

It's a direct appeal to younger voters - with surveys suggesting that students are more likely to vote Labour. It makes the pitch that no-one should be deterred from university because of the cost or fear of debt. Labour has costed the removal of fees - and the reintroduction of maintenance grants - as being worth \u00a311.2bn per year. And this is only England - because education funding is a devolved matter. There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further \u00a3500m per year. This would be covered by the \u00a348.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments. But there are lower estimates. Labour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students. But the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around \u00a37.5bn to \u00a38bn. Labour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction. But they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments. The most recent figures show \u00a376bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years. From this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the \u00a310,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1%. And the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors. Under Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government. But is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged? Universities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion. One of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates. The argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees. This year has seen a fall of 5% in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased. But the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration. Although wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest. Do students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects? Department for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned \u00a310,000 per year more. Among younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at \u00a36,000 per year. But the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade. Labour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters. A survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections. The survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote. The Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives. Is this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government? Could they really entirely scrap fees? There will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees. Germany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees. French undergraduates can study for low fees. In the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about \u00a3100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes. There are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton. And the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland. For England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Scrapping tuition fees in England is the biggest and most expensive proposal in Labour's \u00a325bn worth of pledges for education.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Dan Coats also told a Senate panel he did not think it was \"appropriate\" to discuss his conversations with the president at a public hearing. His comments follow a report that President Donald Trump asked him to derail the Russia investigation. The National Security Agency chief also declined to comment on the matter. Admiral Mike Rogers told a Senate intelligence committee on Wednesday he has never \"been directed to do anything illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate\" as NSA director. Mr Coats echoed Mr Rogers' statements as senators pressed the pair on their interactions with the president. \"I'm willing to come before the committee and tell you what I know and don't know,\" he said. \"What I'm not willing to do is share information I think ought to be protected in an opening hearing,\" Mr Coats told the panel. He is later appearing in a closed session before the committee on Wednesday afternoon. This Senate testimony by intelligence community heads was billed as the undercard to James Comey's appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but it turned out to be a big letdown. Top intelligence officials in the US government have taken a bunker mentality when it comes to the investigation into Russian meddling in the US election, refusing to share details of presidential conversations in open Senate testimony. Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation, it seems, has the spooks spooked. That may come as a relief to a White House that has been buffeted by a seemingly never-ending stream of controversial revelations, from allegations that the president attempted to influence the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to reports of internal divisions within the administration. The president and his aides shouldn't breath easy, however. Although today's testimony was largely a dud, Mr Comey - no longer a government employee, thanks to Mr Trump - will have more leeway to discuss his interactions with the president if he so chooses. His former colleagues my have seen discretion as the better part of valour, but the former director isn't known for backing down from a fight. Mr Coats testimony comes a day after the Washington Post reported that he told associates Mr Trump had tried to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his ties to the Kremlin. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as \"fake news\". The two intelligence chiefs joined acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify before the panel on Wednesday. The lack of answers appeared to frustrate both Democratic and Republican senators, who repeatedly pressed the intelligence officials on the Russia inquiry. Republican Senator Richard Burr, who chairs the committee, ended the hearing by appearing to rebuke the intelligence officials for their testimony. \"At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer,\" he said. The following day will see the much-anticipated testimony of Mr Comey, who was leading one of the Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. He will be quizzed on his interactions with the president before he was sacked. Mr Comey reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president. The conversation occurred the day after the president asked Mr Comey to end the investigation into Mr Flynn during a private dinner, according to the New York Times. Mr Comey believed the attorney general should protect the FBI from White House influence, officials told the paper.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The US director of national intelligence has said he \"never felt pressured\" to influence the inquiry into Russia's political meddling.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: As part of our fight against this, we have a very much underutilised tool - food. In BBC One's Doctor in the House, I try to help 34-year-old Emma Gleeson, who has been experiencing anxiety, depression and panic attacks for many years. She was 19 when she really began struggling with mental health. Following a severe episode of pneumonia, she ended up in intensive care in a coma. When she woke up she was petrified. She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks. During an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud. It is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers. Emma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day. One of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices. Despite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state. \"I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years,\" she said. \"Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health. \"I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume. \"I feel so much better and intend to keep this up.\" The evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing. A landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology. Plus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks. Unfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients. This has to change. Many of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up. When we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term. But, this can actually make things worse in the long term. The food you are eating is literally \"shocking\" your body. By changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks. She also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress. It has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health. Of course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional. There can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood. As a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you: 1. Reduce sugar and processed foods Sugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise. Within two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall. At this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel \"h-angry\" as well - hungry and angry. Low and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline. This can have a negative impact on your mood. 2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats This is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders. Foods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables. 3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts Tryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter. Eat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood. 4. Feed your gut bugs Some scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers. It is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis. The prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut. Best options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. You have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: \"The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. \"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: \"We regret this decision by Washington.\" \"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. \"After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel \"that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre\".

Congratulations also came from Ahok Basuki Purnama, the governor of Jakarta. He became Jakarta's first Christian governor in 50 years when he was elected in 2014. Jemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign. The New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as \"striking\" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network. A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a \"victory over Islamophobia\", and says London is breaking new ground. \"The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think,\" it says. Qatari daily Al-Sharq says: \"Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor.\" Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe. With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that \"Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims\". History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. \"Not to mention that Constantinople/Istanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim,\" he says.

He published several books on his travels around the world and one of the most prized items in the archive is the only surviving notebook from his 1933 trek across Europe. The trek provided the material for his most famous books, 'A Time of Gifts', 'Between the Woods and the Water' and 'The Broken Road'. Thousands of items which occupy 16 metres of shelving took a year to be catalogued by library staff. Along with letters from notable 20th century figures they also uncovered literary manuscripts, sketches and what appears to be an unpublished John Betjeman poem on the back of an envelope. Sir Patrick spent much of World War Two on Nazi-occupied Crete. During his time there he disguised himself as a shepherd to organise guerrilla operations against the Nazis. He led one of the most daring feats of the war in 1944, capturing the commander of the German garrison on Crete. The 1957 film starring Dirk Bogarde 'Ill Met by Moonlight' was based on the operation. Graham Stewart, the library curator who worked on the archive project, said: \"It is a history of the colourful life of a celebrated writer. He was undoubtedly a superstar of his day and his books have, if anything, grown in popularity over the years. \"There has already been a lot of interest in the archive and we expect this to increase now among Leigh Fermor fans and people interested in the 20th century more generally.\" The library is working on digitising some of the archive so it can be viewed on its website. They are also considering holding exhibitions and displays of the collection so more people will be able to see it. The archive was given to the library by the John R Murray Charitable Trust. John Murray was Sir Patrick's publisher and the trust also supported the cataloguing of the collection.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A lifetime of diaries, letters and photographs of a man described as a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond and Graham Greene has opened to the public.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: \"There's a lot going on right now,\"  the singer tells us. And she's not wrong. The follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1. \"And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today,\" she adds. \"It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified.\" The singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear. Describing the concept as \"just hellish\", she tells us: \"I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'.\" So, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart. \"In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury.\" Her third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a \"genuine champion\". \"He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why. \"I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special.\" Here the diary of Laura's day. Tour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day. \"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,\" she admits. \"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up. \"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.\" We arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive. Laura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's \"glad you only find out on the day\". \"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers. \"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.\" Backstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn. \"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,\" says Laura. \"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress. \"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.\" Still in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts. Running through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano. \"Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?\" she laughs. \"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.\" Time for some nourishment. The team (\"there's like millions of them... making it work\") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in. \"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.\" \"[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,\" says Laura. \"He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight. \"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'. \"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.\" Minutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands. She's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved. With the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman. \"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made,\" says Laura. There's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again. Later, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio. \"He made me cry so much,\" says Laura. \"I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel. \"I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon.\" With all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two. \"It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. \" Laura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman. \"That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!\" It's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other. US outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap (\"Because he's fine. And obviously amazing\"). \"I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is,\" says Laura. \"The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment. \"That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance.\" So what now? \"Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away. \"But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out. \"I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!\" You can catch the extended edition of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two on Friday 22 April at 23:15 BST or watch Tuesday night's live episode on the iPlayer now.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "We go behind the scenes with singer Laura Mvula as she prepares to debut her new material and kick off the 48th series of Later... with Jools Holland.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales. Manufacturers reported their highest growth in new orders for nearly three years, with export demand still strong. In retail, there was also a return to optimism - though only just, and despite profitability being squeezed. In tourism, firms reported improving visitor numbers in the final quarter of the year, but falling sales revenues. Responses to the survey, carried out for the Chambers of Commerce by Strathclyde University economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute, were more positive than the economic figures published on Wednesday. The Labour Force Survey and the Gross Domestic Product figures showed weakness in the Scottish economy, while covering an earlier part of 2016 than the Chambers' survey. While the GDP assessment from the Scottish government has seen a sharp contraction in the past year, the Chambers found a more positive picture, with growth in private commercial contracts. However, there are warning signals survey, with tourism companies having difficulties in finding skilled recruits. Retail firms flagged up rising prices. Construction is expecting an investment dip. The weakest of the five sectors covered was finance and business services. More firms in that large part of the economy saw employment fall than saw it rise. But on balance, firms say sales revenue is expected to increase. Neil Amner, chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce economic advisory group, said: \"Our latest economic data shows that many Scottish businesses will have a successful 2017, with business optimism remaining positive for many sectors. \"This is good news for the economy, particularly as we continue to deal with international uncertainty and domestic issues including a rating revaluation and a potential divergence of Income Tax between Scotland and the rest of the UK. \"The overall business mood remains positive but firms expect business growth to be challenged by rising prices, tightening of cash flow and profitability, higher import costs impacted by exchange rates and a likely increase of inflation as the year goes on. \"On the converse side, exporters are continuing to report a healthy growth in trade, though perhaps not quite matching up to their initial expectations. \"Optimism could hardly be more finely balanced and anything that rocks the boat could change the glass from half full to half empty. \"Business success in 2017 will largely depend upon the ability of firms to manage costs and for consumer demand to remain strong in the face of pressures to real incomes.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Manufacturers have reported positive business trends, in the latest survey from the Scottish Chambers of Commerce.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The proceedings in London will be \"the first time that undercover policing has been exposed to the rigour of public examination,\" he told a court. Helen Steel, who had a relationship with an undercover officer, said police committed \"human rights abuses\". But police said undercover officers can play an important role. Lawyers investigating allegations for the Home Office say they have uncovered more than 80 possible miscarriages of justice relating to undercover policing. Investigations revealed officers had also had relationships with women while undercover, and had used the names of dead children. Undercover: The allegations made to date Opening proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Pitchford said: \"It seems likely that the inquiry will expose both creditable and discreditable conduct, practice and management. \"At the conclusion of its investigation, the inquiry will report to the home secretary and make recommendations as to the deployment of undercover police officers in future.\" \"Jacqui\", who had a son with a man she thought was a fellow animal rights activist, did not discover he was an undercover police officer until 25 years after he disappeared from her life. She told the BBC the discovery was \"like an earthquake\". \"I want this inquiry to really get to the truth... and come to some conclusion about whether this money and human misery was worth it\". She wants the officers themselves to have the chance to give evidence, perhaps anonymously, \"and not have to worry about the Official Secrets Act or what's going to happen to them\". She hopes \"what happened to me... what happened to other women, will never happen again. \"There is no circumstance where having sexual relations in order to get information on a group, whatever the group is, is ever justified.\" The home secretary ordered the review after claims police spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, said more than one judge should oversee the case, or its conclusions should be left to a jury. \"You have an old saying - two heads are better than one,\" he said. \"Sometimes one person might miss something and the other one can bring them back to where they're supposed to be\". And Ms Steel said: \"These undercover policing units have committed grievous human rights abuses which are absolutely shocking in a supposedly democratic society. We want to make sure they don't happen again to anybody else, and for that to happen we need the full truth to emerge.\" Case study \"Alison\" was a member of an independent political group in London in the 1990s when she formed a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy. They were together for five years and lived together for four. But Mark disappeared suddenly, saying he'd had a row with his mother and was depressed. \"His disappearance five years after we met was very sudden and unexpected and didn't make sense. I spent a long time trying to find out where he was and why he'd left,\" Alison told Radio 4's Today programme. She believes claims of depression were part of an \"exit strategy\" used by officers. \"I knew I had to get on with my life and I did that, but still carried on looking and searching when I could,\" she added. She later found out \"Mark\" had a wife and children. \"I've carried on with my life, I've met somebody else who I grew up with as a child which was the only reason I was able to trust them was because I knew that they were who they said they were. \"And I've been fortunate enough to have a family, but many of the women who this has happened to have not been so fortunate.\" Lord Justice Pitchford's inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice will look into police infiltration of political and social justice groups in England and Wales since 1968. The inquiry is expected to be split into three parts: establishing what happened, examining the procedures adopted by police to prevent wrongdoing, and recommendations for the future. Preliminary hearings are due to start in the autumn and the inquiry is set to last three years. The inquiry's terms of reference include: The allegations were first widely reported in 2011 when a former undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, offered to help defend, in court, six environmental campaigners whom he had infiltrated. That trial collapsed - and later the same year, there were further revelations of undercover relationships, one of which led to a child. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary. That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. Seven key issues the inquiry will examine. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said undercover policing was an important tactic, but had to be done legally. He told BBC London: \"We, for the police, will make the case that our undercover officers are incredibly brave and they deal with some very dangerous people. \"We think this is a vital part of our toolset and if we don't have it then we don't suffer, but the public might.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The public inquiry into undercover policing may \"expose both creditable and discreditable conduct\", chairman Lord Justice Pitchford has warned.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The All Blacks were five points behind at half-time with a man in the sin-bin as four penalties from Handre Pollard cancelled out Jerome Kaino's early try. A Dan Carter drop-goal and a Beauden Barrett try put the champions ahead. South Africa replied with two penalties but a Carter effort in between secured victory despite ferocious Bok defence. It was seldom pretty but once again in this World Cup there was a gripping finale, the All Blacks holding that two-point lead for the last 12 minutes as their opponents finally tired. No team has ever retained the Webb Ellis trophy, but the All Blacks will be favourites to do so when they meet either Australia or Argentina next Saturday after finding their way through a brutal encounter. This was nothing like the free-flowing attacking rugby that had eviscerated France in the quarter-finals, but in its own way it was just as admirable, as South Africa refused to buckle despite having just 43% possession. The game swung in the 20 minutes after half-time, New Zealand beginning that period five points down and with Kaino off the pitch, but ending it five points up and with Springbok wing Bryan Habana in the sin-bin instead. And despite replacement Pat Lambie cutting the lead to less than a score, the vast experience of the champions saw them through. After Pollard's early penalty, the All Blacks struck back when Kaino thundered through De Jager down the right and touched down one-handed in the corner, but two more pin-point penalties from Pollard gave his side a two-point lead with 20 minutes gone. South Africa were having significant success at the breakdown, New Zealand shipping six penalties in short order, and the world champions looked instead for territory, kicking behind the defence and into the corners. Carter hit the post with a long-range penalty, and despite his side dominating possession and territory the Springbok defensive wall continued to hold. When South Africa finally made it out of their half, they struck again. Kaino was sin-binned for kicking the ball away and Pollard stroked over his fourth penalty to make it 12-7 at the interval, the green-shirted supporters in the capacity crowd starting to believe that the upset was on. The Springboks had not lost to the All Blacks in 21 Tests when leading or level at half-time, but despite being a man down New Zealand closed the gap to two points as a spell of carefully worked territory was capped with a Carter drop-goal. Schalk Burger then lost the ball metres from his own line, the All Blacks went right and drove on through their forwards before Ma'a Nonu sent replacement Barrett diving into the corner. With Habana sin-binned for knocking the ball from scrum-half Aaron Smith's hands and Carter bending over the conversion for 17-12, the match appeared to have turned. Pollard and Carter exchanged penalties, and with replacements pouring on to the pitch and the rain hammering down the two heavyweights went toe to toe. Pat Lambie came on for Pollard to make it 20-18 with 10 minutes to go, and an air of desperation was apparent in both sides. Carter sprinted half the length of the pitch to clear from De Allende, South Africa failed to capitalise from an attacking line-out and New Zealand escaped into opposition territory as the seconds crawled by, running the clock down with a series of drives to celebrate with exhaustion at the end. Ben Smith was faultless under the high ball and Dan Carter's decision-making once again peerless. However, for his muscular, repeated carrying in a relentlessly physical match and the superb run and timing of pass for Beauden Barrettt's critical second-half try, Ma'a Nonu deserves the honour. New Zealand coach Steve Hansen: \"It was always going to be close, they're a great side and they showed that again. I was really proud of our guys, they kept their composure. \"We just needed to come out for the second half and start taking the game to them rather than waiting for them to take it to us. We talked about it at half-time. We talked about keeping composure and talked about winning the first 10 minutes.\" South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer: \"Our discipline in the second half was just not good enough. They coped better with the weather in the second half. Discipline was the most important thing, especially in these rainy conditions. \"We wanted to make our country proud but we didn't. We should have pulled this win through but all credit to the All Blacks, they are a quality side.\" South Africa: Le Roux; Pietersen, Kriel, de Allende, Habana; Pollard, du Preez; Mtawarira, B. du Plessis, Malherbe; Etzebeth, de Jager; Louw, Burger, Vermeulen Replacements: Serfontein for de Allende (80), Lambie for Pollard (66), Nyakane for Mtawarira (53), Strauss for B. du Plessis (53), J. du Plessis for Malherbe (60), Matfield for de Jager (60), Alberts for Burger (64) Not Used: Pienaar Sin Bin: Habana (52) New Zealand: B.

The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft (53m) tower to see under its stone cladding. Ken Evans, from the trust, said the work was \"crucial\". Built on one of the highest points of the Blackdown Hills, the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington's military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo. But according to the trust, it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renovating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been \"expensive and unsustainable\". Mr Evans, the trust's building surveyor, said the radar study was one of several being carried out to \"understand this unique and somewhat complex monument\". \"We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn't flex in the wind quite as much as we expected,\" he said. \"The ground-penetrating radar seeks to identify voids and gaps in the stonework under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the obelisk.\" Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the obelisk and help with a \"more effective repair approach\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A computer model of one of the world's tallest three-sided obelisks is being made to find out why it is falling apart.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of \"extending the service to other countries\". This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. Mr Isla said: \"Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop.\" Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's \"online drive\" was important. \"I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important,\" he said. \"And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. \"So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories.\" The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency.

{"article": "###\nArticle: With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular. \"We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,\" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. \"And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far.\" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM! \"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\" It led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic. For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers. 1987's show was altogether more bizarre. A magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics. At the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses. It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach. She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\". He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star. And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob. Few ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press). Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered. But there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online. In response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.

{"article": "###\nArticle: According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend. More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days. Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal. This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data. One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest. \"Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,\" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity. Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites. He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic. \"It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates,\" he said. He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway. For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time. And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added. Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days. Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system. This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website. \"Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something,\" noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute. He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality. \"This is how people protest these days,\" said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments. He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it. However, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist. \"There are people that care about this issue a lot,\" he told the BBC. \"Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'\" The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Bots appear to be spamming a US regulator's website over a proposed reversal of net neutrality rules, researchers have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

That makes it the second-highest Thanksgiving debut of all time, behind Disney's Frozen, which took $93.6m (\u00a375.3m) on its release in 2013. Some observers have said that Moana and its merchandise are appropriating Pacific Island culture. Disney withdrew a children's costume promoting the film after activists branded it \"brownface\", or mocking of their culture by stereotyping. The costume, a full-body suit with brown skin, traditional tattoos, grass skirt and bone necklace, represented the character Maui, considered a demi-god and ancestor by many Polynesians. Disney said it regretted any offence. JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them fell to second on the US chart, taking $65.8m (\u00a353m). Gossip surrounding Brad Pitt's marriage break-up failed to spark a huge amount of interest in his World War Two romance Allied, which also stars Marion Cotillard. It took $18m (\u00a314.4m) over the long weekend, having cost $85m (\u00a368.5m) to make, landing in fourth spot behind Doctor Strange.

The team's findings are published in EMBO Molecular Medicine. Meliandou is a small village of 31 houses. It sits deep within the Guinean forest region, surrounded by towering reeds and oil palm cultivations - these are believed to have attracted the fruit bats carrying the virus passed on to Emile. During their four-week field trip in April 2014, Dr Fabian Leendertz and colleagues found a large tree stump situated about 50m from Emile's home. Villagers reported that children used to play frequently in the hollow tree. Emile - who died of Ebola in December 2013 - used to play there, according to his friends. The villagers said that the tree burned on March 24, 2014 and that once the tree caught fire, there issued a \"rain of bats\". A large number of these insectivorous free-tailed bats - Mops condylurus in Latin - were collected by the villagers for food, but disposed of the next day after a government-led ban on bushmeat consumption was announced. While bushmeat is thought to be a possible source of Ebola, the scientists believe it didn't trigger the outbreak. Instead, it was Emile's exposure to the bats and their droppings as he played with his friends in the hollowed tree. The scientists took and tested ash samples from the tree and found DNA traces that were a match for the animals. While they were unable to test any of the bushmeat that the villagers had disposed of, they captured and tested any living bats they could find in and around Meliandou. No Ebola could be detected in any of these hundred or so animals, however. But previous tests show this species of bat can carry Ebola. Dr Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, and his colleagues say this must be a pretty rare occurrence though. Dr Leendertz said: \"That is also obvious when you think about how many tonnes of bat meat is consumed every year. \"If more bats carried the virus, we would see outbreaks all the time.\" He says it is vital to find out more about the bats. \"They have moved into human settlements. They do not just live in the trees but also under the roofs of houses in the villages. \"The Ebola virus must jump through colonies from bat to bat, so we need to know more.\" But culling the animals is not the answer. \"We need to find ways to live together with the wildlife.

A union said the idea was \"terrible\" but families deserved to know the truth about funding. A Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said new funding plans would increase the trust's budget by 2.4%. The Olympus Trust runs one secondary, one all-through school and five primary academies in South Gloucestershire, to the north of Bristol. In the letter Mr Baker warned parents of the \"unthinkable\" decisions the trust could be forced to make from September. These include shortening the school day \"because we cannot afford to staff lessons for the whole week\". Other proposals are cutting teaching and support jobs within the schools, increasing class sizes and reducing the curriculum. The letter also says parents may be asked to make regular financial contributions to supplement school funding. Mr Baker said South Gloucestershire was one of the five worst-funded local authorities so had less reserves to draw upon. Beckie Morton, a parent of two daughters at Charlborough Road Primary School, is anxious about the impact any cuts will have on her girls, aged 10 and seven.

But experts are worried that creating national parks often involves removing the people who live in these areas. The study indicated designating forest reserves in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo could displace as many as 1.3 million people. With funding from Norway, Liberia has proposed 30% of their forests become protected areas by 2020. DR Congo, funded by Germany and the Global Environmental Facility, aims to set aside 12-15% of their forested lands. Consultants TMP Systems concluded: \"Governments have targets to expand their protected areas, and now with new climate funding being available the risk is they will use this to expand in a way that doesn't respect local rights,\" said Andy White, from the Rights and Resources Initiative, the campaign group that sponsored the research. \"It could result in the displacement of millions of people.\" Analysts say that this type of displacement has already happened in sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Latin America, and sometimes caused violent conflict. \"I don't think the international community wants to displace rural dwellers in Liberia - but I think if we go about it in the way we are talking about it right now, that is going to be the result,\" said Constance Teague, from Liberia's Sustainable Development Institute. \"We need to recognise that indigenous communities respect the forest and they have worked on [it] for hundreds of years. \"It may not look like what the international community may expect, but this effort to conserve the land does exist.\" Liberia had the largest forest space left in West Africa, largely because of the indigenous communities, she added. The report also looks into the costs of compensating people for the loss of their lands in both Liberia and DR Congo, which range from $200m (\u00c2\u00a3137m) to more than \u00c2\u00a31bn.

{"article": "###\nArticle: A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world. For that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks. There have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability. There are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates. With the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due. Central banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it \"will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review\". Other central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed. What if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs? There are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently. With sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves. In the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets. So if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value. Conversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency. Further action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that. Currency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however. Interest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall. Both options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks. Further quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value). Interest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%). Another risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago. Those earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market. Some observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive. The likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period. The ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Economic policymakers must now decide whether and how they should respond to the UK's vote to leave the EU.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

But, despite the official's concerns, he went ahead with the flight to Medellin. The country's authorities have not yet commented. In a leaked tape, the pilot can be heard warning of a \"total electric failure\" and \"lack of fuel\". The flight missed a planned refuelling stop in Cobija, on the border between Brazil and Bolivia, because the airport did not operate at night, Brazil's O Globo newspaper reported. The pilot had the option to refuel in Bogota, it said, but headed straight to Medellin. Bolivia's President Evo Morales said he would take \"drastic measures\" to determine who was responsible for the crash. On Thursday, the country's aviation authority suspended the operating licence of charter airline LaMia, which was part-owned by the pilot and two other aviation officials. Colombian police released a video (in Spanish) with the moment crew member Erwin Tumiri was rescued alive. It showed him conscious, screaming for his colleagues. He is in hospital and reports in local media suggest he may be discharged this weekend. The other crew member who survived, Ximena Suarez, was said to be in good condition in hospital. The four other survivors were still in intensive care. Neto's father, Helam, said on Facebook that news of his recovery was giving the family \"renewed hope and faith\". \"My son is getting better and better. He has just undergone surgery on his leg and doctors say he will return to football,\" he said. \"We shall continue praying because we still need his discharge from hospital to see him closely.\" Doctors said 24-year-old goalkeeper Jakson Ragnar Follmann would not lose his left leg, after having his right one amputated. Defender Alan Ruschel, 27, had spinal surgery, but his movements were not affected, they added. Journalist Rafael Henzel was listed as stable. The bodies of the Brazilian victims were flown out of Medellin on Friday. Many of the victims were players and staff of Chapecoense, who were due to play in the final of the Copa Sudamericana against Medellin team Atletico Nacional. In the squad's home town of Chapeco, in southern Brazil, temporary structures have been set up in the football stadium for an open-air wake on Saturday. Some 100,000 people are expected to attend. The plane's flight recorders are to be examined in the UK. A full investigation into the crash is expected to take months.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A Brazilian football player who survived a plane crash in Colombia on Monday is recovering and may be able to resume his career, his father says.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The protest by the Stonehenge Alliance was staged outside a consultation event in London earlier. Highways England said it was working to find \"the best solution possible\". The public consultation on its plans for putting the A303 into a 1.8-mile (2.9km) dual carriageway tunnel runs until 5 March. Highways England says the move would cut congestion and improve journey times. The scheme has the backing of English Heritage and the National Trust. Speaking outside the Society of Antiquaries at Burlington House, Robinson suggested a longer tunnel. He said: \"I think the proposal we are being offered is a really old-fashioned one. \"It assumes what needs to be protected is that little clump of stones.\" He said it was only over the past three decades archaeologists had begun to comprehend the wider significance of the site. \"That's a high-class Wiltshire Disneyland experience,\" he said. \"Once it's gone, we'll never get that back. \"If you were going to protect Buckingham Palace, you wouldn't put a tunnel in halfway down the Mall.\" The Stonehenge Alliance wants other options to reduce traffic to be fully explored.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Toffees, back in the tournament for the first time since 2010, controlled much of the game as a Ricardo Rodriguez own goal and a Seamus Coleman header gave them a 2-0 half-time lead. Leighton Baines put the game beyond Wolfsburg with a second-half penalty. Kevin Mirallas drilled in a late fourth for Everton before Rodriguez grabbed a consolation with a curled free-kick. The win puts Everton top of Group H and was just reward for manager Roberto Martinez, who underlined his intention to take the competition seriously by naming a strong side, after calling it \"the perfect next step\" for the club. The Toffees narrowly missed out on the Champions League last season as they finished fifth in the Premier League, but with their participation in this season's Europa League ending a four-year absence, Martinez has expressed a determination to go as far as possible. Everton's attacking display on Thursday will certainly give him confidence of progressing from a group that also contains French side Lille and Russians FK Krasnodar. Martinez had opted not to rest any of his first-team regulars for the visit of Wolfsburg, naming the same side that defeated West Brom 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday. Romelu Lukaku got his first of the campaign in that game and the striker spearheaded an exciting, attacking quartet that also included Aiden McGeady, Naismith and Mirallas. They have all contributed to Everton's impressive statistic of having scored at least two goals in every game this season, and it was of little surprise they each played significant roles in the goals against Wolfsburg. Naismith was the first to make a telling contribution, forcing the opener with Everton's first attack. After winning possession, Naismith ran into the area to receive a Baines pass before stabbing a shot at goal. Rodriguez tried to clear, but the ball cannoned off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, and hit the Wolfsburg full-back again before ending up in his own net. That was Everton's first goal in Europe at Goodison Park since beating Sporting Lisbon 2-1 in February 2010, and it had the buoyant home crowd hungry for more. Everton duly attempted to deliver, with full-backs Baines and Coleman becoming more adventurous as Wolfsburg offered little going forward, and their attacking instincts resulted in the home side's second goal on the stroke of half-time. Mirallas's drive was weakly pushed into the path of Baines, who had followed the shot into the area, and he knocked the ball across goal for Coleman to nod in. Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking introduced Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt for the start of the second half, but within seconds of the restart Everton went further ahead. This time, Robin Knoche's foul on McGeady was deemed to have occurred inside the area, and Baines confidently despatched the resulting penalty. The goal effectively ended Wolfsburg's hopes of returning to Germany with anything to show but, with nothing to lose, they embarked on a spell of dominance. For a good 30 minutes they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and attempts on goal, as Tim Howard produced saves from Luiz Gustavo's opportunistic shot and Rodriguez's well-struck free-kick. Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner was introduced after the hour, with Wolfsburg boss Hecking sensing a possible goal, but instead it was Everton who grabbed a fourth. Mirallas peeled away from defenders to run on to substitute Samuel Eto'o's through ball and he coolly slotted in at Benaglio's near post. There was still time for Wolfsburg to get the consolation their 27 shots on goal deserved, Rodriguez making some amends for his early own goal with a curling free-kick. Everton boss Roberto Martinez: \"The atmosphere was perfect for us to start a very good performance. \"I thought there were two very good sides. On the night the scoreline probably doesn't reflect the difference between the two sides. \"We scored at the right times. Our work-rate was magnificent. We had to defend and we did that really well but every time we went forward we had a clinical touch about us.\" Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking: \"It's obviously not the start we'd hoped for. We were lacking in certain areas, both in terms of finishing and defensive work. \"We should have gone into half-time a goal down and we got hit with a second just before the break.

{"article": "###\nArticle: According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men. Given such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer\". \"We just don't make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked\". Based at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered. \"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\" But if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage? That - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer. The results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer. \"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years\". If that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery. Sitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive. As with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum. \"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery\" says Prof Neal. \"It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "It's a sobering thought for all us carriers of the Y chromosome, but prostate cancer kills almost as many men every year as breast cancer does women.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The imagery, released by US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor and taken on 31 October, shows how almost all the buildings at the airport, on the southern outskirts of Mosul, have been razed. Runways have also been damaged, with wide trenches carved into them and rubble placed along their lengths, Stratfor's analysis says. Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged. About 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants. Government forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts. The damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles. However, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says. IS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July. By comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair. Mirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport. Stratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport. Along with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base. In contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS. After the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them. However, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings. Satellite imagery released last week, showed how IS had constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the northern Iraqi city.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Satellite images of Mosul have revealed how fighters from so-called Islamic State (IS) have destroyed much of the city's airport to render it unusable as Iraqi forces close in.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: While $50m is the starting point for serious wealth, \"in reality your spending power and investing power really gets to the next level when you get to around $100m\", says Catherine Tillotson. Ms Tillotson is joint managing partner of Scorpio Partnership, a London-based firm which advises the super-rich on how to manage their assets, and she says there is a reason for this dividing line between the wealthy elite and the rest of us. \"This is the point at which families will start to think about employing people purely to help them manage their financial affairs,\" she says. There may now be more multi-millionaires and billionaires than ever before in the world, but since the 2008 global financial crisis the wealth gap between the world's top 1% and the rest of us has grown. This increasingly stark division between haves and have-nots is leading to increasing rancour towards the very wealthy, say many social commentators. Robert Kuhn is better placed than many to understand this hostility - a former investment banker and corporate strategist, he is himself among the world's wealthy elite. The world is getting wealthier - we live longer, eat better, are better educated and fewer people live in extreme poverty. But with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, the BBC is investigating the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015. A Richer World 2015 \"I think much of it is justified,\" he says, perhaps surprisingly, \"and I think we should describe why that's the case.\" One of the main reasons for this, he says, is the web. \"We have a very highly wired world with the internet, people are more aware of things - and I think that's a good thing.\" Mr Kuhn is coy about his own net worth. When asked if it is \"tens of millions\" of dollars, he replies, \"I would not like to be too specific, but I wouldn't contradict what you just said.\" Trained as a neuroscientist, Mr Kuhn became an investment banker and then in the early 1990s sold his mergers and acquisitions firm \"at the right time\". He says he worked hard, \"but if I don't acknowledge there was a lot of luck involved I would be fooling myself\". He wants to encourage more and more people to become wealthy, but also to place limits on the amount of wealth that can be passed on to the next generation. \"That gives each generation a chance to have higher social mobility.\" But given that the gap between rich and poor has reached its widest level for 30 years in most developed countries, according to says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group of developed nations - that social mobility is getting harder for many. In the 1980s, the richest 10% had incomes seven times greater than the poorest 10% in the average industrialised country. Now, in those same countries, the richest have incomes nine-and-a half times greater than the poorest, on average. The actual figures vary widely across the 34 OECD's member states. In Denmark the top 10% earn about five times more than the bottom 10% - in Mexico they earn 30 times as much. How much more do the top 10% earn than the bottom 10%? Source: OECD (2011) Other organisations, too, are highlighting this discrepancy between rich and poor. A report this month from the charity Oxfam says the world's wealthiest 1% will own more than 50% of the world's wealth by 2016. \"This is something that we should be very worried about,\" says Mark Pearson, the OECD's deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs. If countries want to boost their economic growth, then they need to take steps to narrow this wealth gap, says the OECD. This goes against the longstanding free market argument that rising wealth at the top will trickle down to everybody else. But, the OECD research suggest that the reverse is true. \"Our finding is that by reducing income inequality, you can boost economic growth,\" Mr Pearson told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme. An increasing wealth gap hinders economic growth because it limits investment in a country's labour force, argues the OECD. Poorer people cannot afford to spend as much as the rich can on their children's education. And that lack of investment in education means a less educated and less flexible workforce in the long run, says the group in its research. It is not just the super-rich that are doing well - those whose business is dealing with super-rich customers are profiting too. Alex Cheatle is chief executive of Ten Group, a lifestyle concierge service that can helps its clients get that exclusive restaurant table, sell-out theatre ticket - or finds that vintage sports car in a particular colour. Ten will even do your window-shopping for you, if you are too rich or famous to be able to do it yourself. \"Very often they will want us to take a picture of the window and get it to them, so they do their window shopping as and when they want to,\" says Mr Cheatle. \"There hasn't really been a crisis for many of our members. Business is booming for us, we've grown every year since 2008 - growing at an average rate of 25-30% a year.\" When you consider how much the super-rich spend, that growth is perhaps not surprising. Over the course of a year, it's reckoned the world's top 1% spend a staggering $45bn (\u00a330bn) on travel and hospitality, $40bn (\u00a326bn) on cars, and $25bn (\u00a316bn) each on art, jewellery and watches. Or course, the ultimate statement of wealth is to have your own super-yacht - complete with helicopter pad, speedboat tenders and even a submarine or two. The world's biggest such boat is currently the Azzam, 180m (590ft) long, launched in 2013 at a reported cost of up to $600m (\u00a3400m) - and the sector has certainly weathered the global slowdown better than many others. Source: Boat International So with the wealth gap rising should the rich pay more tax, and if so would that help? Robert Kuhn - now business and financial commentator - argues that countries that decide to increase taxes on the rich may not see any benefit. He believes increasing income taxes to too high a level would \"inhibit the creation of new wealth which is detrimental to society\". \"I'm just worried about the behaviour and implications if you put too high a tax rate, what that will do to current generations in their energy and focus to create new wealth,\" says Mr Kuhn. At Scipio Partnership, Catherine Tillotson says that focussing on tax misses out the contributions made by many rich patrons to philanthropic and charitable causes. \"The tax question is hugely complicated,\" she says. \"Most families that I've met will say that it is absolutely critical to them that they pay the right amount of tax according to the rules.\" However, \"in many ways those dollars spent on philanthropic passions may be doing more good than they would have done in the tax system\", she says. Yet ever since the financial crisis of 2008, and subsequent global economic slowdown, politicians have come under increasing pressure to increase tax contributions from the richest in their societies. Protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street, which started in 2011 and has since spread to many other countries, have highlighted concern over social and economic inequality worldwide. For his part, Robert Kuhn is not convinced that a widening wealth gap matters in economic terms, but \"it matters in social stability for sure\", he agrees. \"It matters in terms of social mobility of subsequent generations.\" \"To me that's the biggest problem, for any country,\" he says. \"And many countries are facing that.\" Click here for more from BBC's A Richer World, a season exploring the world's wealth, poverty and inequality\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "These days it is not enough just to be a millionaire to count yourself as one of the super-rich - you need to be worth between $50-100m (\u00a333m-\u00a366m).", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant has written to councils reminding them of the temporary ban on fracking in Wales. He said fracking technology was \"unproven\", saying Welsh ministers preferred to look at renewable energy. Fracking is a process of using high pressure water to break up rocks deep underground to release gas and pipe it to the surface. It is a major industry in the United States, but there are concerns about safety, the environment and underground water. There have been protests against applications for test drilling for gas in both the Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham, as well as sites in England. Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has stressed the UK government's support for fracking, and frustration at delays in its development. She has told councils in England to make decisions on applications within 16 weeks, to stop the process being \"dragged out for months\". In his letter to Welsh councils, Mr Sargeant said the new guidance only applied to England and that the moratorium in Wales remained in place. \"The UK government's general support for oil and gas applications is contrary to the approach of the Welsh Government of promoting renewable and low carbon forms of energy through the planning system and other measures,\" he said. \"We still see renewable energy as a key element in ensuring that Wales achieves sustainable development for the benefit of future generations. \"Local planning authorities must ensure that planning applications for renewable energy projects are determined within statutory timescales.\" Plans to devolve control over fracking were confirmed in the Queen's Speech in June following the Conservatives' general election victory.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Fracking for shale gas in Wales should still be opposed despite plans to fast-track such schemes in England, the Welsh government has said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better. But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what: you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal. Another way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope. But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again. Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock. When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as \"an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?\" Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice. The repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old. Jess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey. Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain. Media playback is not supported on this device In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought. Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts. As such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right. But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in. When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers. Fury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations.\" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship? In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs? If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned. \"I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy,\" says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. \"But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous.\" Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them. However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable. When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him. On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, \"cocaine is against the law of the land\". There was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring. It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds. Even if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them. It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: \"We can't have a belt held hostage.\" One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused. \"Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,\" was Hatton's grim assessment. \"He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good. \"But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same.\" Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "For a man often described as capricious, Tyson Fury's chaotic reign as world heavyweight champion was strangely predictable.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

On Saturday, Qatar's foreign minister rejected the list of 13 conditions imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain. They accuse Qatar of backing terrorism - a charge it denies. Qatar has been under unprecedented diplomatic and economic sanctions for more than two weeks, with Iran and Turkey increasingly supplying it with food and other goods. The four countries also want Qatar to reduce its ties with Iran and close a Turkish military base, setting a deadline on Friday of 10 days. Among other things, the fellow Gulf states have demanded the closure of Al Jazeera TV, which is funded by the Qatari government. Mr Tillerson said Qatar was assessing the demands and stressed there were \"significant areas which provide a basis for ongoing dialogue leading to resolution\". He urged the countries to sit together to stop terrorism and counter extremism. \"A lowering of rhetoric would also help ease the tension,\" Mr Tillerson said. After the demands were made on Friday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the dispute was \"a family issue\" that the countries should work out together. On Saturday, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, quoted by Al Jazeera, said: \"The US secretary of state recently called upon the blockading nations to produce a list of grievances that was 'reasonable and actionable'. \"The British foreign secretary asked that the demands be 'measured and realistic.' This list does not satisfy that [sic] criteria.\" He said the demands were proof that the sanctions had \"nothing to do with combating terrorism... [but] limiting Qatar's sovereignty, and outsourcing our foreign policy\". Al Jazeera accused them of trying to silence freedom of expression, adding: \"We assert our right to practise our journalism professionally without bowing to pressure from any government or authority.\" Qatar's main import routes - by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from container ships docked in the UAE - have been disrupted, and much of the surrounding airspace has been closed to its air traffic. However, the small but wealthy country has so far avoided economic collapse by finding alternative routes. Qatari citizens living in neighbouring countries or with family living there have been hit harder, Reuters news agency notes, because of ultimatums issued for them to leave.

Ms Evans' six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute - claims she has dismissed - means she cannot stand. She said she would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage. Ms Evans said UKIP needed to \"break free of its hard-right image and set itself firmly in the common sense centre-ground\" and also conduct some \"internal reform\". The leadership contest has been prompted by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, saying his \"political ambition has been achieved\". In a statement in Westminster, Ms Evans, who had been touted as a possible successor, said: \"I'd very much like to run in that election. \"Unfortunately there are a handful of people at the top of UKIP who, for whatever personal reasons of their own, have made quite sure I can't.\" She claimed the party rulebook had been \"abused\" to suspend her to prevent her from representing the party in May's London Assembly elections and the upcoming leadership contest. Her six-month suspension handed down in March came after an internal disciplinary meeting found she had publicly criticised a fellow candidate and held herself out as a party spokeswoman without authority. Ms Evans - who has always rejected the claims against her - lost a High Court bid to overturn the decision. In the statement, she said: \"I have to face up to reality, there's no way they're going to allow me to put my name on the ballot paper... I've now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP.\" Ms Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that \"allows, and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this\", but she said the support from members had made her \"more determined ever not to give up on UKIP\". She also said that with the right leader, the \"sky was the limit for the party\". Endorsing Lisa Duffy, a district councillor for Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, Ms Evans said she was \"the best chance\" UKIP had to \"change, to grow and to thrive\". She said UKIP needed \"a clean break from the past\" to become more like a political party than \"just a rugby club on tour\". Under Ms Duffy's leadership, she argued, the party would be \"more united and consensual\". Prior to her suspension Ms Evans wrote UKIP's 2015 general election manifesto.

{"article": "###\nArticle: This was the end of the road for Wales in France but the 'Red Wall' - as Wales' players have dubbed their supporters - was still roaring its encouragement at full volume. Wales' momentous campaign was halted by a clinical Portugal side but, watching their team play their first semi-final at a major tournament, this was no occasion for fans to feel deflated. This was a moment of mutual adoration between a team who have established themselves as Wales' greatest, and their unwavering supporters. The bond between Wales' players and fans has been one of the defining features of Euro 2016, a symbiotic relationship that has propelled the country's football to new heights. As well as the anthem, 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', and a repertoire of hymns, the Welsh chant of choice during this tournament has been 'Don't Take Me Home'. There was a poignancy to its airing in Lyon, for it has been a dreamlike existence for Wales fans in France. With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships. But Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite. \"There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long,\" said Coleman. \"We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that.\" Wales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed. It is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home. With every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium. He saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him The messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack. Despite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making. In the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection. Hal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu. There was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: \"When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off.\" From a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players. Gareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football. For all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success. The vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends. Even when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best. These genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football. The death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side. Captain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal. \"My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today,\" he said. \"He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him.\" Speed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of \"There's only one Speedo\" heard at every game. A friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not. Succeeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud. Coleman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey. Absent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait. The current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success. \"The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves,\" he said. \"We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack.\" Wales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup. Planning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement. Just as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff. Returning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Standing hand-in-hand like theatre actors at their curtain call, Wales' players were met with a spine-tingling rendition of the national anthem from their fans following their European Championship semi-final defeat by Portugal.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: It is the second successive time the area has been at the bottom of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), which is published every four years. Statisticians rate almost 7,000 areas in Scotland by standards including income, employability and health. Lower Whitecraigs in East Renfrewshire is classed as the least deprived. Glasgow has 56 of the 100 most deprived areas, down five on 2012. Edinburgh has six, up two on four years ago. The 10 most deprived areas in Scotland: The 10 least deprived areas in Scotland: Renfrewshire Council, which covers the area including Ferguslie Park, said a long-term plan to change the area's fortunes was already under way. Council leader Mark Macmillan said: \"The council has adopted an innovative approach to tackling poverty, recognised as leading the way in Scotland - and the SIMD stats are based on data from last year which does not fully capture the impact of that. \"The figures show the overall picture for Renfrewshire has improved and we believe we are making a difference on the ground. \"In the four years since the last SIMD figures were released, Renfrewshire has seen a 10% real-terms drop in the cash coming our way from Holyrood. \"The deprivation issues affecting Ferguslie and similar areas are long-term and deep-rooted - there are no easy solutions but through our unique approach, we believe we are on the right track.\" The Scottish government said the figures showed \"why Scotland needs a government committed to tackling deep-seated deprivation, poverty and inequalities\". Communities Secretary Angela Constance said: \"This will not be an easy job while we do not have the full levers of power, but I am determined we take on the challenge of making a generational change for those areas that have been in poverty for too long. \"In the face of continuing UK government welfare cuts, an austerity agenda and attempts to take Scotland out of Europe, this will continue to be a long-term challenge.\" She added: \"We are spending \u00c2\u00a3100m protecting people against the worst effects of welfare reform and every pound spent on mitigation measures is a pound less that can be spent on lifting people out of poverty.\" The Scottish Conservatives said the figures should be a \"wake-up call\" to the SNP government. Equalities spokeswoman Annie Wells said: \"There are many causes of deprivation - poverty, family breakdown, drug and alcohol abuse, low educational standards and poor health and we now need a new approach. \"Powers need to be devolved from the Scottish government to enable cities and city-regions to work more closely together to regenerate and redevelop their local economies.\" Scottish Labour's deputy leader Alex Rowley said: \"If we are serious about cutting the gap between the richest and the rest we need to fully understand the picture of poverty in Scotland. \"These numbers are an important start - and they show a Scotland which remains too unequal, and further SNP cuts will only make it worse. \"The most deprived communities in Scotland will suffer more because of hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts to schools and local services, whilst our health boards are faced with millions of pounds of cuts because the SNP aren't giving our NHS the resources it needs.\" Scottish Greens spokeswoman Alison Johnstone MSP said: \"If we're to boost incomes, employment chances and health, we need to see greater ambition from Scottish ministers and local authorities. Yes, the Westminster government's continuing agenda of cuts plays a part, but we cannot let that stop us. \"We can push further on a real Living Wage across our economy, and we can boost people's health by committing to a major programme of housebuilding and energy efficiency measures, along with better public transport and cycling and walking infrastructure.\" Analysis by Reevel Alderson, BBC Scotland Home affairs correspondent The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is published every four years. It provides the government and local authorities with a considerable amount of information aimed at helping them tackle the problem. The index breaks Scotland down into 6,976 \"datazones\", effectively small postcode areas, and ranks levels of deprivation there on seven criteria. These are: income, employment, health, education, housing, access to services and crime. Overall scores are then provided for each datazone. But that is not the full picture. The statisticians say \"deprived\" does not just mean \"poor\" or \"low income\". It can also mean people have fewer resources and opportunities, for example in health and education. One area may score well on educational outcomes for example, but have poor health and access to services. The Scottish government says this \"allows effective analysis for targeting of policies and funding where the aim is to wholly or partly tackle or take account of area concentrations of multiple deprivation.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Ferguslie Park in Paisley has been identified as the area of Scotland with the greatest level of deprivation.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Leroy Fer gave the hosts a first-half lead when he steered the ball home from close range at the back post after Baston Borja's knockdown from a corner. Roberto Firmino levelled shortly after half-time when he headed in from Jordan Henderson's cross. Milner netted the winner six minutes from time after Firmino was fouled. The Liverpool midfielder's goal was just reward a dominant second half from his team, who have now won four Premier League games in a row. It was, however, a little cruel on Swansea, whose spirited performance has probably bought Guidolin a little more time to turn things around. The Swans are above the relegation zone on goal difference and have not won in the league since the opening day of the season. But the club's owners had indicated before the game that the manner of performances would have as much of a bearing on Guidolin's future as the results. Liverpool arrived in south Wales on a high, winning their past three league games and scoring 11 goals in the process. Despite his side's fluency in attack, manager Jurgen Klopp had expressed concerns about the Reds' fragility from set-pieces, and his fears proved well founded as they fell behind in scrappy circumstances. Rattled by their opponents' energetic pressing, Liverpool conceded a corner and, from it, Swansea's \u00a315m record signing Borja headed across goal for Fer to turn the ball in from a yard out. The ragged visitors could have conceded another had Borja not been so wayward with a free header - and Liverpool fans may have feared another hard lucky story, akin to their only defeat of the season at Burnley, on 20 August. However, the visitors were vastly improved in the second half as they recaptured their recent impressive form and equalised thanks to more unsteady set-piece defending, as Firmino headed in from close range. Klopp's side dominated from that point and, after they were initially thwarted by dogged Swansea defending, they eventually struck when Angel Rangel pushed Firmino in the back and Milner calmly converted the penalty. In stark contrast to their high-flying opponents, Swansea entered the game in the midst of a torrid spell chairman Huw Jenkins described in the match programme as the hardest of his 12 years at the helm. Guidolin's future remains in the balance, with his side just one point above the relegation zone and without a league win since beating Burnley on 13 August. His players responded to his plight superbly, harassing Liverpool with a high-octane first-half display. However, they were overwhelmed after the interval and were powerless to stop Guidolin suffering a third successive league defeat for the first time in his tenure. His position is now as uncertain as ever. Although Swansea's owners have started compiling a shortlist of potential successors in the event of Guidolin's sacking, they indicated beforehand that the Italian would be given time to turn the club's fortunes around. Media playback is not supported on this device After yet another game without a win, though, that time may be running out for Guidolin.

Our body language was not good, we were static and it was easy to defend against us. We are not as good as we should have been. \"You have to show why we are here. We showed a reaction, were more organised, clear in all situations and we deserved to win.  Of course I am happy we have had two or three brilliant games in a row. \"If Milner is our top scorer at end of the season with penalties, I have no problem with it. All is good.

{"article": "###\nArticle: It's hard to tell which blow took us more by surprise, the first ever positive steroids test in the history of Scottish rugby, or the fact that  and think it's unfair that so many Scottish, Welsh and Irish teams qualify for the Heineken Cup from a league without relegation. But let's start with  to bulk up and get on in rugby, and leave the Heineken Cup for another day. The public statement made by Sam Chalmers, son of one of our finest ever players Craig, is that he is sorry and that he got the stuff off the internet. It has shades of the convenient \"lone wolf\" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it? Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand Here is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now. What I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you. Some players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more. Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards. Perhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice. So is it possible to get big enough taking food alone? The IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states: \"The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men's and women's Tests and Age Grade Rugby. \"The programme saw a total of 21 anti-doping rule violation cases, equating to 1.36% of the IRB's entire programme.\" That means around 1.4% of elite level players take drugs and try to get away with it. Some of them, you can see from the website, were caught taking the steroid favoured by both Sam Chalmers and disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, stanozolol. The 2011 Word Anti-Doping Agency figures, also available on the IRB website, show there were 5,553 drug tests globally in rugby in 2011, and 61 violations within them - just over 1%. My guess is that there are more chancing it lower down the leagues, or in that scramble to get into the system - but I don't know. When I was in South Africa covering the 1995 Rugby World Cup I wrote then what I repeat now - that the biggest growth in requests at GPs in Capetown nearly 20 years ago was from schoolboys wanting prescriptions for steroids. They were often accompanied by parents. Could this happen here? Sam Chalmers was in the most susceptible group, which is young lads who want to get into professional, or at least top-level, rugby. It's going to be tough on him. But life's not easy. It wasn't easy for the players and coaches in the \"Bloodgate\" affair, or in the various eye-gouging allegations, nor for the other 60-odd rugby players caught by the IRB taking drugs or tampering with their samples. This is a test. He does his time and then he gets back in the game. I will leave you with this thought: I bet you he wasn't alone in this. And I bet there are younger players than Sam Chalmers who haven't been caught. What do you think? Are there pressures on players to take steroids?

{"article": "###\nArticle: The reactor at Yongbyon has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The White House said North Korea should \"focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations\". The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal. But Pyongyang vowed to restart it in 2013, following its third nuclear test and amid high regional tensions. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the international community would not accept North Korea as a nuclear state. \"We will work with our partners in the context of the six-party talks to try to return North Korea to a posture of fulfilling those commitments that they have made,\" he said. \"We will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from the irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tension and should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.\" Six-nation talks involving South Korea, the US, China, Japan and Russia aimed at ending the North's nuclear programme have been stalled since 2009. Experts believe that, when fully operational, the Yongbyon reactor can make one nuclear bomb's worth of plutonium per year. A US think-tank said this year that satellite images suggested work had started at the Yongbyon complex. But Tuesday's announcement was the first official confirmation from North Korea that it had restarted operations there. The state-run news agency KCNA said North Korea was improving its nuclear weapons \"in quality and quantity\". It said that the North was ready to face US hostility with \"nuclear weapons any time\". However, experts say North Korea's nuclear capabilities are unclear. Pyongyang claims it has made a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead on to a missile, which it could launch at its enemies. But US officials have cast doubt on the claim. North Korea has made bellicose threats against its neighbours and the US before, often to coincide with annual joint military exercises held by South Korea and US forces. The two Koreas remain technically at war, because the 1950-1953 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The US has warned North Korea to refrain from \"irresponsible provocation\" after the communist state said its main nuclear facility had resumed normal operations.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: \"Did you set this up?\" Salford City Reds owner Dr Marwan Koukash asked, at the start of the station's rugby league hour this week. The extravagant millionaire has grabbed the ailing Reds by the scruff of the neck and set about building a dream in arguably the sport's most crucial year. Having ruffled feathers with his breathtakingly bold bids to sign Sam Tomkins and Adrian Morley, Koukash has promised to make the Super League strugglers the biggest rugby club in the country within three to four years. What he has definitely done is make people talk about Salford again. Far from being a prickly atmosphere in the studio, there appeared to be real warmth between the extrovert racehorse owner, the man he wants to coach his club - Brian Noble, and the rugby league legend he wants to sign from Warrington - Adrian Morley. \"The more Marwan's the merrier, the better,\" said Noble, the former Great Britain and Bradford Bulls coach still waiting for the right opportunity to return to the sport. \"You just need passionate people with some substance behind them to push the game forward. His passion fills you with enthusiasm, you want to get going and get cracking.\" Those comments will have been music to the ears of the fiercely ambitious Koukash, who learned the art of hard work during three years in a refugee camp in Jordan. He admits he would be honoured for Noble to coach the team he is attempting to assemble at Salford. Another Brian - the Australian Brian Smith - is the other frontrunner. I understand Noble is keen to work with Koukash, but only if he is convinced the dream of this businessman, tempted into the sport by the RFL's chief executive Nigel Wood, can become a reality. A similar discussion about ambition and available funds saw Noble drop out of the running for the Castleford Tigers job before the appointment of Ian Millward, so Salford fans should not expect this to be a done deal. Key to the 'Good Doctor's' dream - he was labelled the 'Mad Doctor' during his outlandish early claims of racehorse success - is his campaign to raise the sport's \u00a31.8m salary cap. Koukash has, for the past few weeks, been lobbying to lift the limit that a club can spend on players to something nearer \u00a32.5m. His argument is that this will not only make the rugby league a more attractive proposition for the best players in Australia and halt a talent drain to rugby union, but even reverse the process and tempt union players to league. Noble agrees that the cap may need a rethink - it was introduced to stop clubs overspending. But the only man to coach a club to three Super League Grand Final victories believes we might now need a carrot to bring in the bigger names to raise the sport's profile. How much of a financial risk would this be? This is a time the sport cannot even attract a title sponsor for Super League - a situation branded unacceptable by the St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus, who cites his own club's deal with tea-makers Typhoo as proof that the sport can pull in the blue-chip brands. Media playback is not supported on this device Koukash clearly has cash and he wants to be able to spend it. But not every club is in a position to chase success in this way. Morley suggests there should be a loophole introduced to have two or three \"star name\" players paid as much as you like outside of the salary cap. Koukash added: \"There should be a mechanism in the sport to allow certain scenarios, clubs or situations to go and spend above the cap.\" The man who made his millions from racehorses clearly feels he will be unable to attract rugby league's thoroughbreds to Salford under the current guidelines. Such an argument is unlikely to be met with a huge nod of approval from the likes of Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington who has built his own successful business model on a strict sliding salary scale at the Super League champions. The bigger question of course is that of the sport's profile in World Cup year. McManus says this is rugby league's \"biggest single financial weakness\". This is not a question about allowing Salford to sign as many players as they want. It is about maximising the exposure of the sport to the world and reaping the financial rewards of that. McManus says the game's governing body needs to take responsibility. \"No sponsor is not acceptable. Either from the club's perspective or from that of the governing body,\" he said. \"Someone has to be answerable for that. It is something none of us are happy with and someone needs to be accountable.\" McManus feels that if these weaknesses in the way the game is marketed are \"readily identified and dealt with\" then the game has never been in a stronger position to prosper and grow. Koukash will expect to be at the forefront of that.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Picture the scene inside the BBC 5 live studio: a millionaire owner of a now managerless Super League club, a highly rated out-of-work coach keen for a return to the sport and an iconic player from a rival club that the owner wants to sign.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He was second fastest in the individual pursuit and seventh in the elimination race with three more events on Monday. Becky James broke the women's sprint Olympic record in qualification and is in Monday's quarter-finals along with fellow Briton Katy Marchant. Cavendish, 31, began his campaign with a hard-fought sixth-placed finish in the scratch race, after Denmark's Lasse Norman Hansen, the London 2012 Olympic champion and Roger Kluge took the top two spots by gaining a lap on the field. In the individual pursuit, Cavendish recorded a time of four minutes 16.878 seconds and caught reigning world champion Colombian Fernando Gaviria Rendon in the process. That temporarily gave the Manxman the outright lead, before Hansen set a new Olympic record of 4:14:982, beating Sir Bradley Wiggins' time set in 2008, to win his second event in a row. However, Hansen dropped from first to sixth overall after he was the first rider to fall out of the elimination race which sees the rider in last position at the end of every second lap ejected from the race. Cavendish was looking comfortable as other riders dropped out but he was ejected, despite not being the last rider over the line, when he overtook a rider while off the inside of the track, and was awarded seventh place. France's Thomas Boudat, the 2014 world champion, leads on 106 points, two more than Italy's Elia Viviani who won the elimination race, with Cavendish third on 96 points. The fourth event - the time trial - starts at 14:21 BST on Monday, before the flying lap and points race events. Wales' James won a silver medal in the keirin on Saturday and maintained her good form on Sunday as she set a new Olympic record during the sprint qualification. James recorded a time of 10.721 seconds to beat the 10.724 set by fellow Briton Victoria Pendleton at the 2012 Olympics in London. That saw James become the fastest qualifier and she comfortably beat Olga Ismayilova of Azerbaijan by a margin of 0.165 secs to move into the quarter-finals, which take place from 14:00 BST on Monday.

So how will the money be spent? At this stage there is little detail. However, from the health minister's statement it seems that the money will go directly to unscheduled care which includes emergency departments. It will also be directed to those areas within hospitals which often experience bed blocking - when patients cannot be discharged as there is nowhere for them to be cared for in the community, including in their own homes.

It claims that Facebook \"intentionally or inadvertently suppressed evidence\" during their previous litigation. Originally, Tyler and Cameron accused Mr Zuckerberg of stealing their idea to create the site. The story of the feud formed the core of the 2010 film \"The Social Network\". The row dates from 2003 when the Winklevosses hired Mr Zuckerberg to write code for their ConnectU site while at Harvard. He never did, but instead set up Facebook, which quickly became a success around the world.

In January 2011 the Winklevosses tried to reopen the case, seeking more money. However, a US appeals court ruled in April that they would have to accept the settlement. The twins initially said they would appeal against the settlement, but decided this week not to pursue that legal avenue. In the most recent suit filed on Thursday with the US District Court of Massachusetts, the Winklevosses and their business partner Divya Narendra said that Facebook hid some crucial information from them during settlement proceedings. The twins said that Mr Zuckerberg did not disclose some important documents in regards to the relationship between him and the brothers while they were at Harvard.

{"article": "###\nArticle: As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops. One of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note. After his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level. Harry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914. He went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated  in zoology and botany. Ironically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause. \"I said to one: 'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?' \"He said: 'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.' \"So I said: 'Well, bugger that.'\" Pincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943. After the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor. One of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme. He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it. \"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\" But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle. His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things. His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.) \"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said. \"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know. \"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\" Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting. \"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his.\" In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's \u00c2\u00a35 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than \u00c2\u00a34 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability. After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service. \"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963. \"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\" One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret\", to his minister of defence. \"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher? \"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\" And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967. What became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations. He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed. \"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said. \"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Chapman Pincher was known as \"the lone wolf of Fleet Street\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device The tournament kicks off with France playing Romania on Friday, 10 June and the final will take place at the Stade de France in Paris on 10 July. Spain are hoping to retain the title they won in 2008 and 2012. England will be appearing at their ninth finals, while Wales and Northern Ireland have qualified for the first time. Good question - because, for the first time, there are 24 teams competing in the finals. That is an increase from the 16 that had taken part in every edition since it was hosted in England in 1996. With six groups of four teams, it means the top two will qualify for the last 16, plus the four best third-placed finishers. In other words, only eight teams will fail to qualify from the group stage. One point could be enough to put your team into the last 16 - and from then the tournament goes to a knockout format. As Greece proved by pulling off a sensational triumph at Euro 2004, trying to predict a winner is a difficult game. World champions Germany are understandably one of the favourites, while holders Spain are also short odds with the bookmakers. Germany finished top of their qualification group but booking their place in France was not without its hiccups - with defeats by Poland and the Republic of Ireland. They have been beaten by France and England since qualifying but remain one to watch. Spain dominated international football between 2008 and 2012 but failed to qualify from their group at the 2014 World Cup. Could this be a last hurrah for Vicente del Bosque's ageing but brilliant side? France won the World Cup as hosts in 1998 - can they repeat the famous success of the team led by Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane and Laurent Blanc? A run into the latter stages by Les Bleus is likely to help restore national morale in a country still recovering from last year's deadly Paris attacks. France are the bookmakers' favourites to win the whole thing, but their form is tricky to gauge because they did not have to qualify for this tournament. Fast on the counter and unified after years of internal division, watch out for talented midfielders Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi. But they cannot call upon prolific Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema. The French Football Federation (FFF) said he would not be picked after being investigated for his part in an alleged plot to blackmail Les Bleus team-mate Mathieu Valbuena, who did not make the squad. Well, there are three of them in France - only Scotland missed out - plus the Republic of Ireland. It is going to get crowded too, because England and Wales are both in Group B, along with Russia and debutants Slovakia. Don't expect much work to get done when England and Wales play each other - that match in Lens will be shown live on BBC One, kick-off 14:00 BST, on Thursday, 16 June. Roy Hodgson's England have a good young team but doubts persist about their defence. They breezed through their qualifying group with a perfect record of 10 wins, while confidence was further boosted with March's impressive win away at world champions Germany. Wales have got Real Madrid star Gareth Bale and plenty of heart. Chris Coleman's side reached their first major tournament in 57 years after losing just once in qualification. Northern Ireland might have numerous players from England's lower leagues but they finished top of their qualifying group, losing just one of their 10 matches. Striker Kyle Lafferty could not get a game for club side Norwich during qualifying (he has since been loaned to Birmingham) but he scored seven crucial goals in nine games for his country. With the 24-team format offering hope to traditionally less-successful nations, five countries have taken advantage to secure their European Championship finals debut. Northern Ireland and Wales, of course, are two of them. Slovakia, who have been drawn alongside England and Wales in Group B, have qualified for the first time as an independent state. A 1-0 win against Spain showed the 2010 World Cup qualifiers can mix it with Europe's elite. Beware England and Wales. Albania have never been near a major finals, but edged out Denmark - the 1992 champions - in their qualifying group thanks to a shock win in Portugal. Oh, and because they were awarded a 3-0 win in Serbia by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after a riot. With a population of roughly 330,000 (comparable to Coventry) and only 21,508 registered players, Iceland are unsurprisingly the smallest nation to ever qualify for the finals. How did they do that? By beating the Netherlands - 1988 winners and three-time semi-finalists - home and away during qualifying. The Dutch, for the first time since 1984, will not be there. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who was voted the world's second best player behind Argentina's Lionel Messi in the 2015 Ballon d'Or vote, heads a star-studded cast. Ronaldo will be leading Portugal's challenge, while Wales hope his club-mate Gareth Bale - the world's most expensive player - can transform his impressive La Liga form onto the international stage. World Cup winners Germany boast a host of stellar names who have impressed in previous tournaments, most notably Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Muller plus Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos. France's challenge is set to be driven by energetic Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, who is still reportedly courting the attention of several English Premier League sides. Belgium are not short of star quality either. Premier League pair Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne will spearhead their quest for a first major tournament win, but the Red Devils are without injured captain Vincent Kompany. And Sweden superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 34, will be hoping to illuminate an international tournament for what could be the final time. The Netherlands' failure to qualify leaves Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben watching from home, while his club-mate Franck Ribery was not named in the France squad, despite suggestions he was considering ending his international retirement. The tournament's 51 games will be staged at 10 locations across France, including new stadiums in Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon and Nice. The opening match - between France and Romania on 10 June - and the 10 July final will be played at the Stade de France in Paris. Building the new venues and renovating historic grounds such as Marseille's Stade Velodrome has cost 1.6bn euros (\u00a31.2bn) - modernisation which was necessary, organisers say, because France did not fully capitalise on hosting the 1998 World Cup. Vibrating stands, floating roofs and adjacent slag heaps - read BBC Sport's venue-by-venue guide In March this year, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) ratified a host of revisions to the laws of the game in an attempt to remove inconsistencies and meet the needs of the modern game. The changes came into effect on 1 June, so will apply for Euro 2016. More than 90 revisions were made, but these are some of the key changes: Kick-off: Previously, the ball had to go forward from kick-off but the rule has been changed to allow it to go in any direction. Pre-match red cards: Players can now be sent off before a match gets under way, although they can be replaced by another player in the match-day squad. Leaving the pitch after treatment: If a player is injured in a challenge resulting in a yellow or red card, they no longer have to leave the field and can have a quick assessment or medical treatment. This change is designed to prevent situations where a team would be temporarily down to 10 players. The end of 'triple punishment': A professional foul inside the area will now normally result in a yellow card for the offender, and not a red. This is to end the so-called triple punishment of penalty, dismissal and suspension, which was seen by some as excessive. There are exceptions for when the offender will receive a red which include holding, pushing or pulling and violent conduct. Goalline technology, already established in the Premier League and elsewhere, will be used at Euro 2016. Yes. But you had better be quick. Most of the group games - including all of England's matches - are sold out. However, as of 9 June there are tickets available to watch Wales and Northern Ireland, plus other games involving some of the smaller nations. There are also tickets available for the opening game between France and Romania - at 395 euros each.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Wales paid a high price for failing to make their extra numbers count when the Wallabies were reduced to 13 men for seven minutes in the second half. Fly-half Bernard Foley kicked all Australia's points, with Dan Bigger twice on target for Wales. Australia now face Scotland in the quarter-final on 18 October, with Wales against South Africa the day before. It was Wales' 11th consecutive defeat against the Australians, a run going back to 2008. Wales coach Warren Gatland's men had their chances but were repelled by some extraordinary defence, with number eight Taulupe Faletau dropping the ball inches from the line and George North at centre held up over the line by Wallabies back-row Ben McCalman. In the long run of narrow losses to Australia, this will rank among the most frustrating for Gatland. There was a lack of composure in a 10-minute period around the hour mark, when Australia's battling 13 held firm. And having seen off the barrage, the Wallabies eventually lifted the siege and were rewarded when Foley's fifth penalty gave his side a two-score cushion with eight minutes remaining. Australia stated their intentions in the opening seconds when they opted to take a scrummage from the first penalty of the game deep in their own half. They almost paid a high price when Gareth Davies sprinted away down the narrow side. But Biggar's fourth-minute penalty was all Wales had to show for their early pressure. Two unyielding defences battered anything that moved, with the breakdown a genuine contest and Wales successfully countering the Wallabies' driving maul. However, as the half wore on and Australia's pack - and scrummage in particular - got on top, the penalty count mounted against the Welsh with Foley profiting. The match was a slow burner but it burst into life at the start of the second half. Australia drove the lineouts with more venom, but Wales took control after the Wallabies incurred the wrath of referee Craig Joubert. Scrum-half Will Genia had a yellow card for failing to retire 10 metres as his opposite number Gareth Davies took a quick penalty and Genia was followed into the bin when second-row Dean Mumm infringed at a lineout. However, Australia's defence while reduced to 13 was simply heroic. Australia's seemingly easier path to a possible final - avoiding South Africa and New Zealand en route - is reward for a courageous and skilful rearguard action. They will look forward to their battle with the Scots, while Wales face a resurgent Springbok side. The nature of yet another defeat to Australia, however, will leave a bitter taste in the mouth. Gareth Davies of Wales was a livewire for the whole of the game and won this accolade. But this was a match won by the defence of Australia.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Cotter will leave the Scotland job and be replaced by Glasgow boss Gregor Townsend at the end of the season. Strauss, who will start at number eight against Ireland on Saturday, says the Scotland players want to send Cotter out on a high. \"When people move on you want to give them a good send off,\" Strauss said. \"It does bring that little bit more of an incentive. You do try that little bit harder. You need emotion to play rugby and it does give you that little extra edge.\" Scotland have not won an opening day Six Nations fixture since the victory over France at Murrayfield in 2006. Their record against Ireland in the championship does not offer much cause for optimism either. Ireland have won 14 of 17 Six Nations matches between the sides. Moreover, Joe Schmidt's side have beaten South Africa, Australia and New Zealand since last summer, with Munster's CJ Stander a stand-out performer, and a player with whom Strauss is well acquainted. \"We shared a room at the Springbok camp for a week back in the day,\" Strauss said. \"He's a farmer from up north in South Africa and I'm more of a beach boy from down in the city in Cape Town. We get along well and he's a very nice guy. \"He's a very tough player. Even with the Bulls, I played for the Lions so there was a very big rivalry between our two South African teams. He was always one of the guys we watched out for. He's come over and he's done exceptionally well.\" Scotland resource coach Nathan Hines, who will follow Cotter to Montpellier in the summer, warned that Schmidt will have pinpointed every Scottish weakness ahead of the Murrayfield clash. \"He brings an unbelievable tactical awareness,\" said Hines, who played under Schmidt at Leinster. \"He goes through the other team with a fine-tooth comb and finds their weaknesses. That gives his teams confidence. \"I was across at the end of last year and spoke to him. The door is never closed with Joe, unless it is and he hasn't told me yet! He's an open guy and we had some good times with Leinster so I'm sure he'll give me a cheeky smile on Saturday before kick-off. \"They're very good at what they do. They find weaknesses and they exploit those weaknesses and make it very hard for you to play. It's about how we combat that and how we make it as difficult as possible for them to execute.\" Ireland captain and hooker Rory Best expects to wage a punishing set-piece battle with Scotland's inexperienced front-row. Edinburgh's Allan Dell, and Glasgow duo Fraser Brown and Zander Fagerson have just nine Test starts between them (three each), but 100-cap Best warns their lack of international appearances will not make for an easy ride. \"When you get that two-three link that play together every week, train together every day, it helps a lot,\" he said. \"There's no doubt that will play into their hands. \"They're inexperienced if you look in terms of Test rugby as a combination but if you look at what they've achieved individually so far this season\u2026.to go to Welford Road and dominate the way Glasgow did and the way they've been performing, we've played against them provincially and it's a very tough task scrumming down against that Glasgow scrum. \"They form two-thirds of the front row on Saturday.

{"article": "###\nArticle: \"Industrial-strength\" extremists cannot be dealt with \"just with force of arms\", he said in a rare interview. During the Iraq war, Mr Petraeus devised the strategy that saw a \"surge\" in US troop numbers and secured support from Sunni tribesmen against al-Qaeda. Iraq's US-backed army is now battling to retake territory seized by IS. Gen Petraeus described the group as \"a formidable enemy\". \"It is really a conventional army that also has elements of an insurgency, and indeed significant terrorist elements as well,\" he said. But when asked to compare IS with its predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq - which Gen Petraeus was instrumental in defeating - he said the latter \"had much greater roots in Iraq and much greater numbers than IS\". The retired general characterised the recent capture by IS of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, as \"a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative of IS being on the defensive - of losing - was shown to be somewhat hollow\". \"I do think Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks or less,\" he added. \"But this was a big setback. At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that's what's going on right now.\" 1974: Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army 2007: Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict 2008: Head of US Central Command 2010: Nato commander in Afghanistan Mid-2011: Leaves military to become CIA director November 2012: Resigns over affair After commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair. Subsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge. But despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years. He was the architect of the \"surge\" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level. He also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda. Not surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill. The keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step. \"You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms,\" he said.  \"You have to have that political component as well.\" Political change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, \"the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it\". As to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts. \"During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight,\" he insists. \"We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight.\" That looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details. \"Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional  level?\" he asks. \"Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them? \"Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort? Can we accelerate the delivery of some of the equipment that Iraq so desperately needs?\" It sounds like the elements of a blueprint for a re-invigorated US effort. But then again - typical Petraeus - there is the political dimension. \"Are we doing all that we can to empower and support those Iraqi leaders, starting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who recognise the need to bring the Sunni Arab population back into the fabric of Iraqi society? And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa?\" In response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel. \"We need to see the same elements of this (previous) comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans.\" Gen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements. He says that more such fighters will spring up once the programme gets under way. And he is very cautious about any Iranian role in combating IS. He insists Iran remains a revolutionary power in the region. \"This is a country that has made progress because of chaos. It has both benefited from chaos and fomented chaos to try to achieve regional hegemony,\" he says. So he believes that \"while there can indeed be some coincidence of interest between the US, its coalition allies in the region and Iran in terms of the defeat of IS (...) the over-arching context is one that gives you reason to have considerable caution in how you go forward in the relationship with Iran\". Gen Petraeus still travels to Iraq regularly. He knows the key players well. And though out of uniform and established in a civilian career as an adviser, he remains the man who did achieve a kind of success in Iraq. That is a commodity that is in short supply today for the Americans and the Iraqi authorities. This  makes the Petraeus approach an attractive model. But the question remains: Can the outcome be the same with the Iraqi military cast in the role of the Americans?\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Ex-CIA Director David Petraeus has told the BBC that Islamic State militants can only be defeated through a dual military and political approach.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: A statement announced the formation of a joint operations room following what it said was an increase in attacks on residential areas and displaced people. Rebels were said to have subsequently launched attacks in the province of Latakia and in neighbouring Hama. Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva said it intended to suspend formal peace talks. The cessation of hostilities brokered by the US and Russia to make way for the talks has resulted in a significant reduction in violence since it took effect on 27 February. But escalating fighting in recent days, particularly around the divided northern city of Aleppo, has left it on the verge of collapse. \"After the increase of violations by regime forces that included targeting displaced people and continuous bombing of residential neighbourhoods, we declare the start of the battle in response,\" said the rebel statement issued on Monday morning. The text was signed by the powerful Islamist groups Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam, as well as several groups that fight under the banner of the Free Syrian Army. Later in the day, the Syrian opposition negotiating team, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said it \"intended to postpone formal participation\" in the peace talks, UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura said. Ever since Syria's truce came into force in late February, there have been repeated violations. But these new attacks are the most significant yet - rebel forces are attacking key front lines, and there have been repeated air strikes by the Syrian military. This upsurge in fighting is putting new pressure on fragile peace talks. Opposition delegates are now discussing if the time has come to leave Geneva - they are reported to have received a letter from rebel forces on the ground, urging them to exert more pressure on the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura who has been mediating in these indirect negotiations between the warring sides. The opposition is now accusing the UN of bias after Mr de Mistura floated a proposal to allow Syria's President Assad  to remain in office, in a ceremonial role. I've heard that idea in recent months from Russian and Iranian sources. But Syrian opposition groups have flatly rejected it - their Western backers are urging them not to walk out but it is becoming increasingly clear that these talks are not going anywhere. The HNC wanted to express its disappointment at the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and in the cessation of hostilities, Mr de Mistura said. But the envoy added that the HNC would remain in Geneva and informal discussions with the two sides would continue with a view to \"taking stock\" on Friday. The US on Monday called on Russia to use its influence on the Syrian government to stop attacks that threatened the seven-week cessation of hostilities as well as the Geneva peace talks, a State Department official said. Separately, President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held an \"intense conversation\" on Monday that covered Syria, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Meanwhile, four Syrians including three children in the Turkish town of Kilis were killed in rocket fire from Syrian territory controlled by co-called Islamic State (IS), the local governor's office said. The Turkish military fired artillery in response, Hurriyet newspaper reported. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebels had launched an assault on the positions of government forces and their allies in Latakia's northern countryside early on Monday and by midday had made advances. The UK-based monitoring group also said rebels were close to taking over the town of Khirbat al-Naqus, in the strategically important Sahl al-Ghab plain in the north-west of Hama province. A Syrian military source confirmed the attacks, according to the Reuters news agency. Latakia is the heartland of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, and the Sahl al-Ghab lies just to the east of the coastal mountains where Mr Assad's ancestral village of Qardaha is located. Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory said four people were killed in heavy government air strikes in northern Homs province. Twenty-two civilians were killed over the weekend in Aleppo, with at least 16 dying as a result of rebel shell- and sniper-fire and the six others dying in government air strikes, according to the group. Militants from the group known as Islamic State (IS), which along with the rival jihadist group al-Nusra Front is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, have meanwhile seized more territory from rebel groups near the Turkish border north of Aleppo, forcing some 35,000 civilians to flee towards the opposition-held town of Azaz. Medecins Sans Frontieres warned on Monday that the situation was now critical for more than 100,000 displaced people trapped around Azaz, with active fighting just 7km (four miles) away and the border closed for all but the most seriously ill Syrians.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Rebels say they have begun a new battle in north-western Syria in response to alleged truce violations by the army.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

But he played down differences with the Welsh Government over Brexit. The UK government is under pressure to change its approach to leaving the EU, which critics call a \"hard Brexit\". Mr Cairns's predecessor, Stephen Crabb, claimed the election had changed the terms of the Brexit debate. The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP is backing calls from Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson for Theresa May to adopt a more flexible approach that achieves a consensus across parties. Mr Crabb told BBC Wales: \"The majority of business opinion in Wales and the UK supports Britain staying in the single market and staying in the customs union but still coming out of the European Union legally. \"And I think that argument needs to get looked at far more closely and if we can't achieve a satisfactory deal based on membership of the single market we need something that is pretty close to it if it's going to achieve the consensus that it needs to across the parties.\" Wales Office Minister Guto Bebb said the process of listening to devolved governments had begun. \"It is seven times more important now because of the result of the election that the devolved countries have a real voice in the process of leaving the European Union,\" he said.

Jurors found the fans who died as a result of the 1989 crush were unlawfully killed. The families also complained about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police. They called on the home secretary to put the force into remedial measures. It is understood the proposed 'Hillsborough Law' would seek to place a further onus on those in public office to cooperate positively with investigations. The families were told about developments in two ongoing criminal investigations into the disaster at the meetings with the home secretary, which were held in Warrington. Theresa May has previously praised the dignity and determination of the victims' relatives. Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said: \"I myself for the very first time felt - I'm sure the families did as well - that at last there's a home secretary that's actually listening to them.\" The home secretary has met some Hillsborough families before, but this is the first time that she's spoken directly to them since the inquests ended. Theresa May spent several hours in Warrington, meeting separately with the two main groups of relatives. The atmosphere was said to be heated, with some of the families complaining directly to her about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police during the inquests. Some relatives asked for assurances that there will be criminal prosecutions, and I'm told that they wanted to make sure that the home secretary personally understood the emotional toll that the two-year inquests have taken.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Inciting people to harass others online, known as virtual mobbing, could also result in court action, under new Crown Prosecution Service guidance. The director of public prosecutions said it means the CPS would prosecute just as if offences occurred offline. But she stressed this did not mean prosecutors could \"stifle free speech\". The new guidance aims to help police identify online crimes more easily. It also highlights those who post people's personal information, such as bank details - known as doxxing. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: \"The internet's not an anonymous place where people can post without any consequences. People should think about their own conduct. \"If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline.\" However, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example \"if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test\". One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times. The abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name. \"The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid; they even set up a website in her name.\" The woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter. \"Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author. \"It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech; it's hate speech,\" she said. She added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures. The incidents are now being investigated by police. Kevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work. He said: \"Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police. \"It's been a nightmare; it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it\". Mr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad. \"With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything,\" he added. The CPS says it will use \"considerable caution\" before charging those posting \"grossly offensive\" material. The changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability. The CPS also said underage \"sexting\" between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve \"exploitation, grooming or bullying\" may lead to legal action. Ms Saunders told the BBC: \"If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it,\" she said. Asked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: \"We probably need to think about it.\" A new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015.

The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.

Carrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election. Eyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front. Faizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital. \"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me. A heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead. Faizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan. Faizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day. The voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties. The soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me. One report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds. Separatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government. Disillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away. Why Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear. By all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire. Whatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy. A picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera. \"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family. Grief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn. \"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again. Then she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains. \"The blood of a martyr never goes waste,\" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. \"One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].\" A brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy. \"I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.\" Outside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness. They said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because \"they are our brothers and don't kill civilians\" and are \"fighting for freedom\". More than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces. \"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,\" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk. Since February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape. The army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments. Recently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army. \"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,\" an army officer told me. The region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley. Kashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule. Many say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated. Militancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s. But young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of \"becoming irrelevant\", as a leader of an opposition party told me. \"This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,\" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher. \"India needs to be worried, very worried about this.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The day 12-year-old Faizan Fayaz Dar died, he woke up in the morning in his hilltop home in Budgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, had a cup of salted tea, recited the Koran and pottered around in the kitchen where his mother prepared breakfast for the family.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Bids have been submitted by Abellio, Arriva, KeolisAmey and MTR for the next Wales and Borders franchise. The successful bidder will have to make a slice of its profits available to be reinvested in the railway. They will also be responsible for delivering a major upgrade to the rail network in and around Cardiff as part of the Metro scheme. A contract will be awarded in early 2018. The four bids are being assessed by Transport for Wales (TfW), a Welsh government-owned company, as part of what ministers said would be an \"ambitious and creative not for profit model\". Officials said the four preferred bidders were the only four to come forward for the contract. The Welsh government has set out its ambitions for the Metro but it will be up to the bidders to propose how it will operate, as well as drawing up plans to build a new rail or tram system. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent This is the first time that the Welsh Government has awarded a rail franchise. It did not have the power to do so when the all-Wales franchise was awarded to Arriva. The model this time will focus on what level and quality of service the various bidders can offer. They will be asked to outline what they will do to drive up the numbers of passengers taking trains and buses across Wales. While the Metro for south Wales will be part of the bid, the company's proposals will also be scrutinised in terms of how they will affect all geographical locations. Whichever company wins will have a cap set on how much profit they can make. We do not yet know at what level that will be set but once that is passed remaining profit will go to the body responsible - Transport for Wales - to be reinvested in public transport in Wales. That cap will be for negotiation. Each company is expected to put together its own particular mix of heavy rail, bus and possibly light rail. The preferred contractor is expected to be known by early 2018. Negotiations are underway with Network Rail about handing over responsibility for the track on the core Valleys lines to the franchise holder. The current franchise is run by Arriva Trains Wales which gets a subsidy from the Welsh Government of between \u00a3150m and \u00a3180m a year. Rail privatisation laws stop the Welsh Government giving the contract to public sector bodies. The Welsh Government has lobbied for more powers, but said its requests have been turned down in Westminster. Officials said in time TfW may evolve to take on more responsibilities, similar to Transport for London. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said new trains, quicker journeys and modernised technology were priorities for the franchise. \"We now have four highly skilled, experienced companies entering the next, competitive phase and I am keen to hear more from them about what they can offer Wales and how they can deliver on our plans for integrated public transport,\" he said. \"Over the next 10 years I envisage significant strides in the delivery of our public transport network including the electrification of the Swansea, Valleys and north Wales lines, a South and North Wales Metro and widespread structural improvements that are already in the pipeline.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Four foreign-owned firms are competing to run train services in Wales and create the \u00a3600m South Wales Metro.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The 80-year-old, a champion of the Doric dialect, was a compere and producer of variety shows before branching out into broadcasting. He has presented the Scottish dance music show Take the Floor since the early 1980s. BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie said: \"Robbie is one of Scotland's most recognisable voices.\" Robbie, explaining his broadcasting philosophy, said: \"I like to think that I am broadcasting to a lady in the top tenement in Glasgow at the same time as I am chatting to a lady in a croft.\" Thousands of listeners tune in to Take the Floor on Saturday evenings. But Robbie has decided it is now time to step down from the show - and this weekend will be his final programme as permanent host. Born in Dunecht in Aberdeenshire in 1936, he admits that when he first entered broadcasting he was initially \"slated\" for his accent in some quarters, and was just a \"rough and ready country loon\". Since then his work has been recognised with an MBE, and he was also inducted into a hall of fame by the Trad Music Awards. His career has included stints on BBC Scotland's Beechgrove Garden and presenting televised sheepdog trials. As well as his broadcast work, Robbie has been a regular commentator on the Highland Games circuit - including the famous Braemar Gathering which is attended by The Queen and members of the royal family - and a much-travelled concert compere. He has written books on Scottish dance music and Scottish country dancing, and has written a newspaper column in Doric. Robbie, who turned 80 in May this year, prepares for Take the Floor at BBC Scotland's Beechgrove Terrace base. Robbie said of the future: \"I am taking a break, that is for sure.\" He added with a smile: \"But, as they say, I am a wanted man. I hope sincerely you have not heard the last of this Doric voice.\" Mr MacQuarrie said: \"Robbie is one Scotland's most recognisable voices and, over the years, he has been like a close family friend for many of our listeners. \"A passionate supporter of traditional Scottish music, Robbie has, over more than three decades, shared his in-depth knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm with generations of Radio Scotland audiences. \"I'd like to thank him personally, both for his work with Radio Scotland and also for his passionate commitment, championing Scottish traditional music across the country. \"Although we're grateful that he'll continue to work for us on one-off broadcasts in future, we wish him well as he prepares to Take the Floor for the final time.\" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was \"sad\" the \"broadcasting legend\" was stepping down from Take the Floor and wished him the best. Robbie said: \"It has been 35 years of top-class music. From the great masters of the past to present-day performers, Scottish dance music continues to be a vibrant scene. \"So the time has come for me to hand over to a younger presenter (Gary Innes) and wish the Take the Floor team aw the best.\" He added: \"I would also like to thank the many hundreds of musicians, whose music we've featured, and the audiences in halls at our recordings across the country who have provided a great atmosphere for the show. \"I'll be looking fur ye all and aw the best.\" Robbie, who is married to Esma, concluded: \"It's been 35 years of sheer pleasure.\" Robbie's final Take the Floor will be broadcast on Saturday 17 September at 19:00.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Veteran broadcaster Robbie Shepherd is leaving BBC Radio Scotland's Take the Floor after 35 years this weekend.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Accrington Stanley boss John Coleman told BBC Radio Lancashire: \"I'm delighted with the result as it was a difficult game.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77. The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of \"a true son of Limerick\", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: \"He was the absolute governor.\" A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: \"He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. \"All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. \"And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. \"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\" Evans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\". \"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\" BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\". \"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said. \"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. \"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\" Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\". \"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\". Sir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. \"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\" President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\". The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. \"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. \"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\". Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\" Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\". Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Unions at BAE Systems have warned of possible delays to funding for the Royal Navy's new frigates. But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson insisted there was no change to the timetable. Labour said it was vital that promises were kept while the Lib Dems called for an end to uncertainty. The UK government confirmed in its Strategic Defence and Security Review last November that eight Type 26 frigates would be built on the Clyde, although the total number was scaled back from 13. In the meantime, the yards are being sustained by Ministry of Defence orders for new offshore patrol vessels. But after briefings with management, the GMB union said last week that work on the new frigates would not begin until 2017 and raised concerns that up to 800 jobs could be lost if there was any backsliding on commitments. SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was \"gravely concerned\" by the developments. She said: \"The future of both Govan and Scotstoun depend on these orders. Solemn promises were made in the run-up to the referendum and if those promises are broken, it will be seriously damaging for the shipyards but I think people across Scotland will feel very let down by the parties that made those promises.\" She added: \"I think the government has the responsibility to make cast iron assurances here.\" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said she had held discussions with shipyard workers and BAE management  about the need to protect jobs. She said: \"It's my deep regret that Labour didn't win the general election - so the Tories have to fulfil their promise to the workers in the yards, and I'll be making that case every step of the way.\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also expressed frustration about the uncertainty. \"There are serious concerns about the future of orders at the yards and it's important that the Conservative government gives an absolute commitment. We've got to end this feast and famine of orders at the yards,\" he said. The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, however, said she had been given assurances by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that nothing had changed. She said: \"He confirmed there had been no change to the orders that were set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review last year. \"That means all eight Type 26 anti-submarine frigates that are coming, plus the light frigate order on top of that, and the two offshore patrol vessels. They are coming to the Clyde, as discussed last year, to the same timetable and the same number.\" A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: \"Following the Strategic Defence and Security Review, we are working with the Ministry of Defence to agree a revised baseline for the Type 26 ships and a production schedule for the two additional offshore patrol vessels in Glasgow. \"We are engaging our trades unions as we work through this process.

Mr Trump has won three of the first four contests held so far. Next week's vote in 11 states is held on what is known as Super Tuesday. The three men are seeking to be named as the Republican candidate in November's presidential election. At long last the Republican candidates have come to the realisation that Donald Trump can actually win this race, but it may be too late. For more than two hours, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took turns throwing punches at the New Yorker. They attacked him on his business record; they mentioned hypocrisy; they questioned his conservative credentials; and they criticised the lack of detail in his policies and his reliance on bluster. \"We're having a lot of fun up here, aren't we?\" the front-runner quipped at one point. But the truth is that Mr Trump was on his heels for much of the evening. The challenge for the men who would unseat the leader, however, is that the best time to bludgeon a candidate is before it is clear circumstances are forcing you to act. In a campaign where authenticity is worshipped above all, Thursday's fireworks could smack of the kind of political expediency many associate with traditional politicians. Both Mr Cruz and Mr Rubio drew blood with their attacks but Mr Trump will be likely to emerge unbowed. How Cruz and Rubio double-teamed Trump What makes Super Tuesday super? - The long day of voting explained The Republicans who hate Trump - Lifelong members of the party speak out Mr Rubio, who has come second in several recent contests, mounted a series of attacks on Mr Trump. \"If he hadn't inherited $200m, you know where Donald Trump would be?\" Mr Rubio said in one tense exchange. \"Selling watches in Manhattan.\" Mr Rubio also criticised Mr Trump's failed online education venture, Trump University, and assailed him for hiring foreign workers rather than Americans in his construction projects. Mr Trump shot back: \"I hired tens of thousands of people. You've hired nobody.\" The billionaire real estate mogul found himself increasingly on the defensive about his business dealings and his conservative credentials. In other exchanges The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at. Trump on Rubio: \"This guy's a choke artist [not able to deliver on stage].\" Rubio to Trump: \"You're a lousy businessman.\" \"If he hadn't inherited $200m, you know where Donald Trump would be right now, selling watches in Manhattan.\" Trump to Cruz: \"This guy is a liar.\" Cruz response: \"Falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie, and it's something Donald does daily.\" Trump to Cruz: \"You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican senator backing you. Not one\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6You should be ashamed of yourself.\" \"I know you're embarrassed.\" Rubio to Trump: \"You're the only person on this stage that's ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.\" Trump response: \"I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. I've hired tens of thousands of people over my job. You've hired nobody. You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards.\" Mr Trump has been extremely popular despite his controversial comments about deporting millions of undocumented workers and banning Muslims from travelling to the US. He is currently leading in 10 out of 11 states holding contests on Super Tuesday when a quarter of the total numbers of delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination will be up for grabs. He has 82 Republican party delegates, Mr Cruz has 17 and Mr Rubio has 16. To become the Republican party's nominee, a candidate has to have 1,237 total state delegates. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will compete for 1,004 delegates on Super Tuesday.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Russia's CG effects and the brilliance of Australia's singing were not enough to defeat jazz artist Jamala. Russia's Sergey Lazarev had been the bookies' top tip for days, possibly because his song was so similar to 2015's Swedish winner - with innovative staging and a slick song to match. But Ukraine stole past Russia and Australia under the radar, with the new voting system providing a huge surprise at the 11th hour when Jamala was crowned as winner. She is the first Crimean Tatar to perform at the contest, and her song, 1944, could not have been further from Eurovision's usual fare. It deals with Stalin, Crimea and claims of ethnic cleansing. Jamala dedicated it to her great-grandmother and her five children, who were deported by Soviet troops from Crimea in 1944. Simon Bennett, head of the International OGAE Eurovision fan club, told the BBC that former Soviet countries that would \"normally vote for Russia\" had sent it a message by voting for Ukraine instead. Political songs are not allowed at Eurovision, but 1944 was permitted because it was based on historic fact, rather than current politics. BBC Music reporter Mark Savage wrote in February that Ukraine's 2004 Eurovision winner, Ruslana, had said the song 1944 had struck a chord over current circumstances in the region. \"This song... is precisely what we are all suffering in Ukraine today,\" she said, referencing Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014. Jamala simply said after her win: \"I want peace and love for everyone,\" adding at the press conference: \"I was sure that if you talk about truth it really can touch people.\" But John Kennedy O'Connor, broadcaster, author and Eurovision expert, was not happy with Saturday's result. \"I'm disappointed that a dirge about genocide and delivering a pointed slap in Russia's face has won this year,\" he told the BBC. \"This contest should never be a political platform and I'm almost angry that it's been turned into one, despite the very clear rule book on the matter.\" He said that while third place was an \"excellent result\", the Russians must be \"sick as parrots\" at the moment. Alasdair Rendall, president of the Eurovision fan club OGAE UK, said immediate reaction to Jamala's victory was \"mixed\". \"Many people admired her strong voice and the impressive visuals on show,\" he told the BBC. \"However many are already saying it won due to the strong political message it carried rather than its musical quality.\" As for Australia, Bennett said it was \"neutral and easy to give your votes to\" while O'Connor said it was \"time for them to go away and start AsiaVision now\", referring to a song contest for Asia Pacific countries. And at the other end of the leaderboard, hopes for the UK's Joe and Jake were dashed when they came third from bottom. Rendall felt the result was \"totally undeserved\" and Bennett was \"distraught for them\". But O'Connor added: \"The fact that their single is not in the UK top 100 after a month [plus] since its release says it all really.\" Joe and Jake told the BBC they had given \"it their all\" and sent \"huge congratulations\" to Jamala. The new voting system also got a mixed reception, with Bennett saying it was \"a disaster that destroyed the atmosphere\"' while Rendall said it had \"really ramped up the tension\". It seems that the only thing everyone agreed on was the show itself. \"Congratulations to Swedish TV for putting on one of the most impressive, exciting and high quality Eurovisions ever,\" said Rendall.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "So Ukraine confounded the bookmakers and Eurovision commentators who had been convinced that Russia - or possibly Australia - would win.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS \u00a32bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time \"vetting eligibility\" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to \"turn GPs into border guards\" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a \"fair contribution\". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must \"transcend\" financial concerns, but collecting an extra \u00a3500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. \"We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one,\" he added. By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent The issue of which foreigners are entitled to treatment and which are not is complex. The first thing to say is if someone needs emergency care - for example if they have an accident - the NHS will treat them no matter where they come from. Another exemption is if someone has an infectious disease as treatment helps protect the wider public. Beyond that the UK has reciprocal agreements with most European countries and 28 other nations, including countries such as Canada and Australia. It means if their residents need care while here temporarily - either on holiday or working - they will be seen and the NHS will then reclaim the cost of that care from the other country. The research released by the Department of Health shows the NHS is not very good at clawing that money back. This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify. Meanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed. The rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the \"most thorough research there has ever been\" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on \"incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions\", but it says the estimates are the \"best that can be made at present\", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been \"completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know\". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a \u00a3200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise \u00a3200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, \"deliberate health tourism\" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between \u00a360m and \u00a380m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is \"uncertain\" and the \"plausible range\" of the cost is \u00a320m-\u00a3100m. Frequent visitors \"taking advantage\" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further \u00a350m-\u00a3200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the \"conservative\" \u00a3500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just \u00a373m a year is recouped out of more than \u00a3460m at present. This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \"We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment.\" But he added the figures were based on a \"large number of assumptions\" and was more about \"spin than substance\". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's \u00a3500m savings figure was \"exaggerated\", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed \u00a3200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to \"get their money's worth\", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than \u00a3200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a \"new border agency\" in policing the NHS. \"The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments,\" she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been \"hugely overstated\" and was in fact a \"very small part of NHS expenditure\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Up to \u00a3500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Prof Les Mayhew said the difference between the sexes peaked at nearly six years in the 1970s. Life expectancy is going up all round, but the rates for men are increasing faster. Plummeting smoking rates in men are thought to explain a lot of the change. Prof Mayhew, a professor of statistics at Cass Business School, analysed life expectancy data in England and Wales. He was working out how long 30-year-olds could expect to live. His findings show men languishing far behind for decades, but now starting to get closer to women. If current trends continue, Prof Mayhew predicts, both sexes could, on average, be living to the age of 87 in 2030. He said: \"What's interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so, male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy.\" The reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle. \"One of the main reasons, I think, is the trend in the prevalence of smoking. Smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80% of males smoked. \"This was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy, so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years.\" Other factors are thought to be safer, more office-based, jobs. Millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining. Healthcare has meant more men live longer as well. People with heart disease, which is more common in men, can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago. By contrast, women started smoking later than men.   , but are falling fast in men. A boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies, as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30. Boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents. It means that women could still have the edge for some time to come. Prof David Leon, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"In virtually all countries in the world, women do have a slight advantage.\" However, he said the gap was definitely closing in some countries. Countries with lower levels of life expectancy, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, showed very little difference between the genders. This was due to the prevalence of infectious diseases which \"are not picky about men and women\", he said. In countries that had defeated most infectious diseases, such as in Eastern Europe, \"there is a much bigger difference, mostly dominated by lifestyle factors\". At one point in the 1990s, the gap between life expectancies in Russia reached 13 years. Prof Leon said it was an \"absolutely massive\" difference in a \"very gendered society\". In his third class of countries, such as the UK, the gap in life expectancies is starting to narrow. He said: \"Men are getting a bit better behaved and women are adopting male life expectancies.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The gap between male and female life expectancy is closing and men could catch up by 2030, according to an adviser for the Office for National Statistics.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Mr King is not the rather better-known writer of horror novels (though his robust opinions on the dangers of monetary largesse can tend towards sleepless nights). This Mr King is senior economic adviser at HSBC. And a China expert. Writing about the country's economic slowdown in 2012, he said: \"China's debt fuelled expansion was never likely to be sustainable.\" The amber warning lights came back on this morning when the ratings agency Moody's downgraded China's credit rating, its investor benchmark for analysing the country's economic performance. Now, the rating is still A1 - the agency's fifth highest - but nevertheless does highlight growing concerns about the amount of debt the world's most populous country is carrying. The problem is not the government's direct debt, which at less than 40% of GDP is modest by Western standards, or the eminently manageable 3% deficit (the rate at which that debt is rising). The issue is the debt being carried by the country's companies, or more specifically the \"state-owned enterprises\" (SOEs) that constitute the grumbling and sometimes out-of-date engines of the Chinese economy. And the debts being carried by the country's local governments - which, of course, in a state the size of China, are a little more significant than those of an English town council, say. Here, the picture is different. SOE debt stands at 115% of GDP, a figure that is steadily rising and is far higher than, say, comparable figures for Japan and South Korea (where comparable debts are around 30%). Moody's estimates that bringing the leverage of those firms down to more manageable levels would cost more than $400bn (\u00a3308bn). At the same time, China's own finance ministry has warned that some local authorities are struggling to meet day-to-day operating costs, as they find themselves caught between supporting often inefficient local businesses - making steel, for example - or funding the unpaid debts and unemployment costs associated with shutting down or reforming the mainstays of regional economies. Now, China certainly has deep pockets. Its foreign currency reserves stand at more than $3tn and its annual current account surplus is $200bn. So, debt sustainability is not a near and present danger. But, if the old joke is that when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold, when it comes to China, it only has to think about reaching for its handkerchief and the global economy can suffer a fit of the vapours. When China announced weaker-than-expected economic data at the beginning of 2016, world stock markets went into free fall and commodity prices tumbled. In 2010, average Chinese growth hovered around 10%. It is now between 6% and 7%. More manageable than the heady days of seven years ago, yes, but there are fears that a lack of economic reform could see growth fall to 5% as President Xi Jinping balances the drive for a more efficient economy (with all the dislocating restructuring costs and possible job losses that could incur) with the need to keep political tension to a minimum. In a jittery world, China's debt mountain can loom larger than the fundamentals suggest. And Moody's downgrade is just one straw in the wind. Asian stock markets hardly paused for breath when it was announced earlier this morning and warnings of a \"hard landing\" for the Chinese economy have been oft-predicted and not materialised. But, Chinese bond yields are rising as investors demand a higher risk premium for funding the government's liabilities. There is no need to rush for the lifeboats yet. However, it's probably worth knowing where they are.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "In his new book Grave New World, Stephen King says: \"For better or worse, China is simply too big to be ignored.\"", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Colin Green, a professor of water economics, says Thames Water will make at least \u00a3100m a year if it goes ahead. The utility firm says the tunnel is the best way to stop sewage dumping in the River Thames. A Thames Water spokesman said it was the most economical way to deal with the problem and no decision on financing the project had been made. Prof Green, from Middlesex University, claims under current water industry regulations Thames Water would receive 4.5% every year on the super sewer investment. But he claims the utility firm could borrow the money required to build the tunnel for around 2% a year. The professor said: \"If you want to change this we are going to have to change the price incentives.\" Prof Green said the regulatory regime - run by Ofwat - has created an incentive to invest money rather than to operate more efficiently. A spokesman for Thames Water said: \"Detailed and independently-chaired studies have identified the Thames Tunnel as the most economical way to deal with the 39m tonnes of sewage that overflows to the Thames in a typical year. \"We do not yet know who will finance and build the tunnel, but it is by no means certain that it will be Thames Water.\" \"The rate of return for investors will be set independently by Ofwat,\" he added. Prof Green also claimed Thames Water would also see a rise in returns once the loan to build the tunnel was paid off - although this may not happen for 30 to 40 years. \"Even when the loans have been paid off for the tunnel we (the consumer) will have to go on paying for the full capital value of that asset. \"The way the price system works Thames Water will then be getting a return of about 14% upon their share value, just because of the tunnel.\" Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"We are working with Thames Water, Defra and other stakeholders to support the development and financing of the Thames Tunnel and to ensure that any incurred costs are efficient and continue to represent best value to customers.\" Hammersmith and Fulham Council has been campaigning for a cheaper solution to London's sewage problem - such as a shorter tunnel. Councillor Harry Phibbs said: \"It is quite within the rules, but what is happening is that within the rules they will be able to charge customers a much higher rate for the money they are borrowing than they are actually paying themselves. \"This means that they have got a huge financial interest in the scheme going ahead on the most expensive gold-plated basis possible.\" He called on the government to \"call in the scheme\" and look seriously at the alternatives.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "An expert has claimed controversial plans to build a \u00a33.6bn 'super sewer' in London are motivated by profit.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales, TLP disputed NRW's figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them. \"Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these 'what if' scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication,\" the briefing said. \"These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures [on fish],\" the briefing adds.

That is the number of teams in the Czech top division and Fitzel believes young talent would have a greater chance to shine in a bigger league. \"I am sure a 16-team league has helped our youth development,\" he said. Fitzel was involved with the Czech youth teams from 1998 to 2005, and helped bring through the likes of Tomas Rosicky and Petr Cech. After a spell as the national coach of Malta he has returned as technical director and general manager of the Czech Republic national team. Fitzel has overseen improved fortunes at all levels of the game after the country missed on qualification for the 2010 World Cup. Since then, the Czech Republic were quarter-finalists in the 2012 European Championships and finished top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group. \"If we did not have a 16-team league and we only had 12, only a few youth players would get a chance,\" Fitzel told BBC Scotland. \"The bigger the league, the more teams are playing at a higher level, and the more young players are getting a chance. The more they play, the more they improve through experience of playing in the top league.\" From next season, the Czech First League will be ranked nine places above Scotland in the Uefa coefficient rankings, with two teams qualifying for the Champions League qualifiers. However, Fitzel admits a 16-team league does have its pitfalls and they could end up moving in the opposite direction. \"Currently here in the Czech Republic we are discussing maybe having 10 or 12 teams playing each other four times,\" Fitzel said. \"At the moment we do not play enough games. \"A 16-team league has allowed us to have a winter break of two-and-a-half months. We finish at the end of December and start again at the beginning of March. But it means we only play 14 games in spring and all the clubs are saying we should have more games. \"In a smaller league, maybe there are more interesting games. We are looking at the ice hockey league, where right now they have play-offs and the stadia there is sold-out; even the relegation play-offs. That's fantastic income for the clubs and the stadiums hold 13,000 - 15,000 people.\" Fitzel, like many in Europe, has looked on with interest at the Scottish game in the last few years. He says the 12-12-18 set-up that was proposed in 2013 was interesting, but feels clubs should listen to what the supporters want. \"It's an interesting idea,\" he added. \"It is something new, and I always feel if you don't try it then you don't know. \"From my point of view it is interesting to play for relegation or promotion. It could be a long period of games. \"It seems interesting, but the question is do the people want to see this? \"If you have enough teams for a 16 top division, they don't need to be equal.

He is very popular and he has endeared himself with everybody.\" Hannon, who has 300 horses based at his stables near Marlborough, is the son of former flat jockey champion Richard Hannon Sr. Moore has enjoyed great success under the guidance of Hannon and won the champion apprentice title in 2003. Since then, Moore has established himself as one of the most respected flat jockeys in horse racing and was champion jockey in 2006, 2008 and 2009. \"Ryan Moore performs on the big stage and he is the best jockey in the world at the moment.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Officials from Cuba and Norway, the two countries brokering the peace process, said a week of discussions would begin in Havana on 10 December. Colombia's president stopped the talks after the rebels seized Gen Ruben Dario Alzate and two others on 16 November. The captives were released on Sunday. They were handed over to a humanitarian mission led by the International Red Cross and taken to a military base near the city of Medellin before travelling to be reunited with their families. \"We consider the crisis over and announce that we have agreed that the next cycle of conversations will take place between 10 and 17 December,\" Reuters quoted a joint statement read by a Cuban official as saying. The negotiators said the next round of talks would focus on a de-escalation of the conflict, and on meeting the relatives of victims. They also said the parties had agreed to establish a permanent system to deal with any future crises. They will reconvene around mid-January, on a date not yet determined. The negotiations have been under way in Havana since November 2012 and aim to bring an end to five decades of conflict, in which 220,000 people are estimated to have died. The Red Cross and the Farc said that the handover on Sunday had taken place in a remote location in Choco province, an isolated jungle region on Colombia's Pacific Coast. Gen Alzate, Cpl Jorge Rodriguez and lawyer Gloria Urrego had been kidnapped 14 days earlier while travelling along the Atrato river by boat. They had ventured into territory dominated by the Farc in civilian clothes and without a security detail. The Farc said they kidnapped the general because they were unhappy that President Juan Manuel Santos had continued military operations against them during peace talks. The left-wing rebel group has renewed calls for both sides to call a ceasefire while the peace negotiations proceed. The government has rejected such calls, saying that a truce would only help the rebel group regroup and rearm. Gen Alzate resigned from his post on Monday, saying he should have taken more security precautions.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The Colombian government and Farc rebels have agreed to resume peace talks, which were suspended last month over the abduction of an army general, mediators say.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Biologists studied a group of Sydney octopuses off Australia's east coast and observed a range of behaviour that may indicate complex social signalling. Octopuses that stand tall, turn dark and spread their web in a \"Nosferatu pose\" are likely showing aggression. Conversely, octopuses may display a pale colour after losing a fight or when trying to avoid conflict. It was previously believed that octopuses were largely solitary creatures. Changes to body colour and other behaviour were interpreted as tactics to avoid predators. But Prof Peter Godfrey-Smith said the unique study, based on 53 hours of footage and published on Friday in the journal Current Biology, provided a novel perspective on octopus behaviour. \"[An aggressive] octopus will turn very dark, stand in a way that accentuates its size and it will often seek to stand on a higher spot,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith, who co-authored the report, said. \"Clearly the unusual stance is not a physiological response. It makes it look as big as it can possibly be, with its arms spread out below and the mantle, the back part of the animal, raised over the head. \"The dark colour is produced in concert with those size-accentuating behaviours. There's no particular physiological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression, but it does give the impression of a larger object.\" The researchers, based in Australia and the US, dubbed the stance the \"Nosferatu pose\", referring to the classic 1920s horror film, because the spread of the octopus's web was reminiscent of a vampire's cape. Octopuses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggressors and also produced high-contrast patterns known as deimatic displays. The contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octopuses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out, or in the presence of an aggressive individual. \"Suppose there's a large, aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den, if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-confrontational behaviour,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith said. The study also found that two octopuses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity, while a darker-coloured octopus was likely to stand its ground against a lighter-coloured octopus. Another cephalopod, the cuttlefish, shows a similar set of features, with aggressive males darkening their faces and paler males withdrawing from fights. The unusually high number of octopuses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible. Prof Godfrey-Smith's co-author David Scheel and his students combed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octopuses. This included the Nosferatu pose, along with reaching, grappling and mating. Watching these long videos was \"much more exhausting than I expected\", Prof Godfrey Smith said. \"Identifying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult, because they change colour and shape. \"If the octopus wanders out of the frame, there's not much you can do.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Octopuses may have more complex social interactions than previously believed, a new study has found.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Listen: Saints fans feeling let down by Koeman BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast Koeman, who has been headhunted by new Everton owner Farhad Moshiri, will sign a deal reported to be worth about \u00a36m a year. The former Netherlands international, who is on holiday, will take brother Erwin and fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg with him to Goodison Park. Saints have finished seventh and sixth under Koeman - their best Premier League campaigns. Martinez promised Champions League qualification when appointed but Everton finished 11th in 2015-16, his third year at the club. In April, Saints chairman Ralph Krueger said discussions with Koeman over a new deal were progressing \"in a very good direction\", but added the club was \"not in any real hurry\". And last month the former Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona defender said he expected to stay with the Saints for the final year of his contract. Koeman made more than 763 appearances as a player, scoring 253 goals, and won the 1988 European Championship with the Netherlands. He won the European Cup - now the Champions League - with PSV Eindhoven in 1988 and Barcelona in 1992, scoring the winner for the latter against Sampdoria at Wembley.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The problem is that so many of the initiatives and ideas sold to the country as ground-breaking prove to be business as usual. So the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid went out of his way to sound no-nonsense and tough today. He accused some English councils of \"fudging\" the numbers on housing need in their area and warned them that he was not going to allow that to happen anymore. But the response to the government's proposals has been decidedly mixed. Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey described them as \"feeble beyond belief\". \"Re-treading old ground\" was how the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers described the White Paper.  \"Kicking the can down the road,\" one big investment fund said. The chief executive of the housebuilder Inland Homes, Stephen Wicks, bemoaned the failure to relax rules on green belt development. \"Brownfield in itself can't possibly sustain the long-term housing requirements of the UK,\" he said.  \"It can go an awful long way but there needs to be a relaxation of some green belt to enable us to deliver the numbers that we are required to do.\" The White Paper does include measures to encourage developers, housing associations and councils to build more affordable homes more quickly, both to rent and to buy. But this government seems to speak with two voices on housing: the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live, but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt. The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bullet-points is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed. Ministers now accept England needs 250,000 new homes every year, they have described the housing market as \"broken\" and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it. But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a \"realistic plan\" to achieve that.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Over the last three decades, governments of various stripes have promised radical change to solve England's housing crisis and today's White Paper is no exception.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The attack happened early on Sunday near the town of Dogubayezit in Agri province, near the border with Iran. Since 24 July, Turkey has carried out hundreds of air raids on PKK bases on both sides of the Iraq-Turkey border. A Turkish state news agency, Anadolu, said the tractor was carrying two tons of explosives that were detonated by a suicide bomber. Turkey's army said in a statement that \"long-range guns\" were also found. Four of the injured were in a serious condition. The statement said the Karabulak Gendarmerie Station was hit at around 03:00 local time on Sunday (midnight GMT). Images in the Turkish press showed a badly-damaged building with the roof destroyed. One report said the blast was so strong that houses in a village several hundred metres away were hit by debris and some residents were slightly injured. The Dogan news agency added that militants also set up ambushes on roads to prevent medical teams getting to the scene. There has been no comment from the PKK so far. AFP news agency said it would be the first time the group was accused of deploying a suicide bomber during recent clashes. Turkey says the group was behind a number of attacks in the last two weeks: Turkey's official news agency says about 260 Kurdish fighters have been killed in strikes in northern Iraq and Turkey since 24 July. It has also targeted positions held by the Islamic State group. At least six people were killed and several wounded in further Turkish air strikes on Saturday east of Erbil, said local officials. The pro-PKK Firat news agency described an attack on the village of Zerkel as a \"massacre\". Iraqi Kurdish President Massoud Barzani said: \"We condemn the bombing, which led to the martyrdom of the citizens of the Kurdish region, and we call on Turkey to not repeat the bombing of civilians.\" The Turkish military on Sunday said it had investigated the incident and dismissed claims that there could have been civilian casualties in Zerkel, Reuters reported. Turkey considers both the PKK and IS terrorist organisations. The PKK has been fighting Turkey for an autonomous homeland for the Kurds. More than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since the PKK began an armed uprising in 1984. In 2012, the government and PKK began peace talks and the following year a ceasefire was agreed. However, the ceasefire ended in effect when Turkey launched raids against Kurdish separatist camps in northern Iraq last month. The raids came after the PKK reportedly killed two Turkish police officers in retaliation for an attack claimed by Islamic State and what the PKK sees as Turkey's collaboration with IS.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Two Turkish soldiers have been killed and 31 wounded in a suicide attack by Kurdish PKK militants, the Turkish military says.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The experimental aircraft, which has a wingspan bigger than a jumbo but weighs little more than a large car, left Nanjing at 02:39 (18:39 GMT). It is likely to take Mr Borschberg five to six days of continuous flight to reach his central Pacific destination. He will try to stay awake for much of that time, taking only short catnaps. His progress will be monitored the entire way from a control room in Monaco. Meteorologists and flight strategists will constantly update him on the best route to follow. The journey is the seventh leg in the single-seat, propeller-driven aircraft's quest to circumnavigate the globe using just the energy of the Sun. The project made steady progress after starting out from Abu Dhabi in March, but was held up for more than a month on China's east coast waiting for the right weather conditions over the ocean. Solar Impulse needs not only favourable winds to help push it forward, but also clear skies to enable its 17,000 wing-mounted photovoltaic cells to achieve peak performance. These cells must have the vehicle's lithium-ion batteries fully topped up at dusk to sustain flying through to dawn the next day. Mr Borschberg is a highly experienced pilot, and as a trained engineer is completely familiar with the plane's systems. Nonetheless, he is in no doubt how tough the mission will be. \"It's more in the end about myself; it's going to be an inner-voyage,\" he told the BBC before departure. \"It's going to be a discovery about how I feel and how I sustain myself during these five or six days in the air.\" And Bertrand Piccard - who has flown Solar Impulse on other stages of the voyage - told the BBC: \"There's one pilot at a time, so the pilot needs to do everything on his own. And it's a very large aeroplane, big wingspans, sensitive to turbulence, flying quite slow. \"So sometimes it's difficult to handle when the air moves. But we have an auto-pilot, we have toilets on board, we have food for days, water reserves and everything, and we are well trained.\" The distance to Kalaeloa airport on Hawaii's O'ahu island is more than 8,000km (5,000 miles). If, early on in the flight, the weather turns bad or he encounters a major technical problem, Mr Borschberg can always choose to turn around and head back to China or Japan. But there will come a point where that option is denied to him, and Mr Borschberg and his support team have had to prepare for the possibility of ditching in the Pacific if something goes seriously wrong. The pilot himself would not go down with the plane because of the risk of electrocution once in the water. Instead, he would bail out with a dinghy and wait for a ship to come and pick him up. If he succeeds in reaching Kalaeloa airport, he will set several aviation records - not least the longest-duration journey for a single-seater plane. The purpose of the Solar Impulse project is not really to showcase a particular kind of future for aviation, but rather to demonstrate the potential of clean technologies more generally.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Two separate proceedings, one by a cross-party group of MLAs and another from victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, were heard earlier this month. A judge ruled there was nothing in the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement to prevent the government triggering Article 50, the formal legal process for leaving the EU. The UK government welcomed the ruling. Mr McCord said that \"without a doubt\" he would be taking his case to the Supreme Court. \"The judge has left the door open,\" he said. \"We're right in what we're doing for the people of this country.\" The challenge by politicians from Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Alliance Party and the Green Party suggested the UK government could not trigger Article 50 without a parliamentary vote. They said the Brexit decision should be examined and voted on by parliament or, failing that, by the Northern Ireland Assembly. Earlier this month, the High Court in London heard that the need for parliament to give its approval before the Brexit process starts is of huge \"constitutional importance\". Mr McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries and who now campaigns for victims of violence during Northern Ireland's Troubles, brought Friday's other legal bid. His challenge came amid worries that the Brexit vote could mean an end to EU funding for peace projects that help Troubles victims. His lawyer argued that the Good Friday Agreement meant Westminster had given sovereignty of Northern Ireland over to its people, and that leaving the EU would have a \"catastrophic effect\" for the peace process. Major constitutional changes such as leaving the EU could not therefore be imposed by a Westminster government, Mr McCord's barrister said. But the judge ruled that prerogative power could still be used, arguing that triggering Article 50 is merely the start of a legislative process in which acts of parliament will be necessary. \"While the wind of change may be about to blow, the precise direction in which it will blows cannot be determined,\" he said. He concluded that discussing the use of prerogative power to enact the EU referendum result was not suitable for a judicial review. It had also been argued that the Good Friday Agreement gave the power of sovereignty to the people of Northern Ireland and that the Westminster government could not therefore make the region leave the EU. But the judge rejected that argument as well, saying he could not see anything in the agreement or the relevant legislation that confirmed that view. All of the issues raised by the applicants were rejected by the court. The pound dropped in the wake of the ruling, with analysts speculating that it had weighed on the currency. Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's John O'Down said Remain-supporting politicians would \"continue to explore every legal and political option open to us\" to ensure that citizens' rights are \"protected and upheld\". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood acknowledged that the cost of taking the case to the Supreme Court could be an issue. But he added: \"We believe very, very strongly that Brexit would have a hugely detrimental effect on people here,\" he said. \"It would be a huge constitutional shock to people and to the political process here.\" Remaining within the EU would give Troubles victims a better chance of getting justice, Mr McCord said. \"The British government have no interest in victims,\" he added. Mr McCord's barrister Ciaran O'Hare said the judgement was \"no surprise\" and they welcomed the ruling. \"It is a very important constitutional case and it will have to dealt with in the Supreme Court,\" he said. Welcoming the ruling, a government spokesman said: \"As we have always made clear, we stand by our commitments under the Belfast Agreement and the outcome of the EU referendum doesn't change this.\" The case has been closely watched by Westminster, especially as similar hearings are due for judgement in the near future.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A landmark legal challenge against Brexit has been rejected at the High Court in Belfast.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Matthew Todd Miller, a 24-year-old US citizen, was sentenced to six years of hard labour on 14 September 2014 for what state media described as \"hostile acts\" against North Korea. He had been in custody since 10 April when, according to North Korean sources, he destroyed his tourist visa and demanded asylum. The youngest of four sons, he grew up in Bakersfield, California, and both his parents were oil engineers. Described by former classmates as \"quiet but extremely intelligent\", he learnt Korean on his first trip to South Korea four years ago while visiting a brother stationed there with the US air force.  A California neighbour said he liked it so much he stayed. Notes produced in court, apparently in Mr Miller's handwriting, suggested he had become a fugitive because he was involved with Wikileaks, the organisation that leaked US state secrets. However, the BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul says it is unclear if they were written under duress or not, and if any of the allegations were true. In an interview this month with CNN, attended by North Korean officials, Mr Miller said: \"I will say that I prepared to violate the law of the DPRK before coming here.\" He also said he deliberately committed his \"crime\", without specifying what he had done wrong. The charges he faced in trial were non-specified. Mr Bae, a Korean-American known in North Korea as Pae Jun-ho, was arrested in November 2012 as he entered the north-eastern port city of Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China. He has been described as both a tour operator and Christian missionary. North Korea said he used his tourism business to form groups to overthrow the government. He was sentenced to 15 years' hard labour in May 2013. Mr Bae's trial and conviction came at a time of high tension between the US and North Korea, in the wake of the communist state's third nuclear test. So far efforts to secure his release have been unsuccessful. His family say he has several health complaints including diabetes and liver problems. Jeffrey Edward Fowle: June 2014 - October 2014 Jeffrey Fowle entered North Korea on 29 April and was detained as he was leaving the country some time between mid-May and early June, according to reports. He is a 56-year-old US citizen from Miamisburg, Ohio, who works for the city. The father of three came into the country as a tourist but, according to reports, left a Bible in his hotel room - something the North considers incendiary. He was facing a trial for non-specified charges but was released following negotiations and returned to the US in October 2014. Mr Jun, a businessman, was arrested in November 2010 for an unspecified \"grave crime\", and detained in North Korea for six months. It was reported that he may have been involved in missionary work during business trips to North Korea. The communist state views organised religious activity as a potential challenge to its leadership. North Korean state media said that he had confessed to wrongdoing, and that he was treated well in custody, being allowed diplomatic contact and family phone calls. Visiting US officials repeatedly requested his release, including Robert King, the US special envoy for human rights, who was visiting North Korea to assess its food situation. During Mr King's visit, the North agreed to free Mr Jun on \"humanitarian grounds\". Mr Jun was flown out with Mr King's delegation. The US had suspended its food aid to North Korea in 2009 amid concerns over the North's nuclear programme, and Mr King stressed that Pyongyang had not been promised aid in return for Mr King's release. Aijalon Mahli Gomes, 31, was sentenced to eight years' hard labour for illegally entering North Korea from China in 2010. He had been teaching English in South Korea, but reportedly crossed into North Korea in January 2010. He was arrested in April that year. Mr Gomes, a devout Christian, was thought to have gone to North Korea on a one-man peace mission. North Korean media said he tried to commit suicide while in detention. Mr Gomes' detention came during a period of heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In March 2010, South Korea's Cheonan warship sank, killing 46 sailors. International investigators said that the vessel had been sunk by a North Korean torpedo, something Pyongyang denied. Soon afterwards, the US and South Korea took part in joint military drills, sparking anger from North Korea. Six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programme had also been stalled for several months. Former US President Jimmy Carter secured Mr Gomes' release during a \"private humanitarian trip\" to North Korea in August 2010. During his trip, he met North Korean officials, including ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam. North Korean media said that Kim Yong-nam expressed North Korea's commitment to resuming six-party negotiations on its nuclear programme, during his talks with Mr Carter. US Christian activist Robert Park entered North Korea on 25 December 2009, carrying a letter for then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. He crossed into North Korea from China by walking over a frozen river. He was arrested almost instantly. He told the BBC he had decided to make the trip because his conscience had been tormented by the thought of people suffering in North Korea. He said he was tortured while in custody. In February, North Korea said it had decided to \"forgive and release\" Mr Park. North Korean media said he confessed to crossing the border, and agreed that his view of North Korea was based on false reports. He now realised that religious freedom was ensured in North Korea, North Korea's main news agency added - something his colleagues described as \"propaganda\". Laura Ling and Euna Lee, reporters for California-based Current TV, were jailed for illegally entering North Korea and sentenced to 12 years' hard labour. They had been filming a video about North Korean refugees, and admitted to entering North Korea for a short time, but said they were on the Chinese side of the border when they were arrested. \"We were firmly back inside China when the soldiers apprehended us,\" they said. \"We tried with all our might to cling to bushes, ground, anything that would keep us on Chinese soil, but we were no match for the determined soldiers.\" They said it was possible that they had been lured into a trap. Their detention took place during a period of high tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. In April, North Korea dropped out of six-party denuclearisation talks, and in May, it said it had successfully completed its second nuclear test. The two journalists were issued with a special pardon after former US President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, and returned to Los Angeles on a chartered flight with Mr Clinton. Official North Korean reports said that Mr Clinton had apologised on behalf of the US for the actions of the two reporters - something denied by the US, who said Mr Clinton carried no message to North Korea. Correspondents said that it appeared that the women had been held in relative comfort in a guest house for most of their time in North Korea, and been used by North Korea as a diplomatic tool to secure a visit by a high-profile US envoy.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Students said the error meant there were two possible correct answers to the multiple choice questions. Officials have said they will accept two answers as correct in each case, and the head of the national exam board has offered to resign. The annual test determines the academic futures of high school students. South Korean media said the mistake would affect the test scores of about 3,600-4,000 students. \"I express deep regret and recognise an urgent need to improve the question-making process,\" Education Minister Hwang Woo-Yea said in a statement broadcast on television. \"We will investigate the root cause of the problem,\" Mr Hwang said. About 640,000 students sat the nine-hour standardised test, called the College Scholastic Ability Test, on 13 November at 1,216 testing sites across the country, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. Many students engage in intense studying for years in preparation for the exam, often with the involvement of their parents in what is an extremely competitive academic environment. A good score would mean a spot in one of South Korea's top universities. The suspect multiple-choice questions, one in the biology exam and one in the English language paper, sparked an uproar with parents and students complaining to the website of the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation (KICE) which administers the exam. Last year's exam was also controversial because of a mistake in one of the questions in the world geology section. After a year-long legal battle, Seoul High Court ruled in favour of four students who said the question was flawed. \"We did our best this year to prevent erroneous questions... but again there were faulty questions, causing chaos and inconvenience among exam takers, their parents and teachers,\" said Kim Sung-Hoon, head of KICE.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "South Korea's education minister has apologised after two faulty questions in the national college entrance exam left thousands of students confused.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Turkish forces have targeted so-called Islamic State (IS) inside Syria, but have also gone after Kurdish fighters in the same region. The pursuit of Kurdish forces, whom Ankara considers terrorists, has led to criticism by the United States. Ankara contacted the US ambassador on Wednesday over comments the foreign ministry called \"unacceptable\". A US military spokesman had expressed hopes on Tuesday that, rather than see Turkey pursue Kurdish fighters, \"all parties involved are going to stop shooting at each other and focus\" on IS. On Wednesday, Russia added its voice, with the foreign affairs ministry calling on Turkey to avoid strikes in Syria on opposition and ethnic groups fighting Islamic State, including Syrian Kurds. \"Turkey is a sovereign state, it is a legitimate state,\" said Turkey's EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik. \"To suggest it is on a par with a terrorist organisation and suggest there are talks between them, that a deal has been reached between them, this is unacceptable.\" Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday that \"operations will continue until all terrorist elements have been neutralised, until all threats to our borders, our lands and our citizens are completely over\". The foreign ministry phoned US ambassador John Bass on Wednesday morning. While Ankara and Washington are allies, the US depends on Kurdish forces for support in attacking IS in northern Syria. However, Turkey has insisted Kurdish militia, which it regards as terrorists, retreat east across the Euphrates river. Turkey has been fighting a Kurdish insurgency in its south-east for decades and fears Kurdish gains in northern Syria will fuel Kurdish separatism at home. Turkish forces and allied factions of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) forced IS out of the Syrian border city of Jarablus a week ago and have since pounded neighbouring villages held by Kurdish-led, US-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF). The Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG), which dominates the SDF, says its forces have withdrawn, and that the Turkish action against the group was a \"pretext\" for occupying Syria. At the weekend, the US Defence Secretary Ash Carter called on Turkey to stay focused on the fight against IS and not to engage the SDF. He said the US was \"very supportive\" of Turkey's general counter-IS activities and its efforts to secure the border - but not the area south of Jarablus. Separately, a spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised EU states for their response to a failed coup in the country last month. Ibrahim Kalin said it was unacceptable that EU countries had not sent high-level representatives to Turkey after the coup attempt, which the presidency says was planned by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a powerful US-based Muslim cleric.

The embattled electronics giant is hoping for loans of up to 250bn yen ($2.2bn; \u00c2\u00a31.6bn), said Nikkei daily. Toshiba confirmed it was in talks but said the details had not been decided. The Nikkei daily said Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, Mizuho Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank were like to provide the funds as early as this month. The funds are vital for the survival of the Japanese conglomerate as it streamlines its bloated businesses, whose poor performances had gone unnoticed during almost a decade of false accounting. The restructuring comes after the company admitted in 2015 it had overstated its profits by $1.3bn over seven years. As part of the efforts to balance its books, the firm has announced major job cuts and the selling of several plants and units to external investors. Toshiba currently employs almost 200,000 people. Its shares have lost about 40% of their value since April last year, when news of the profit overstatement began to emerge. In July, its chief executive, president and six other high-level executives resigned from the company.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Tenants cleared from Glancalvie Estate set up a camp in Croick Churchyard, near Ardgay, 170 years ago. Some who camped scratched their names into the glass of the church windows. The names are still visible today. A descendant of one of the infants fed from the decanter has handed it into the care of Inverness Museum. Donald MacMillan's grandmother Christina Ross was the daughter of John Ross, a shepherd who with his family and others was cleared from the estate. They set up a temporary camp at Croick Church in Sutherland in May 1845. The families later left to settle in other parts of the Highlands. With help from High Life Highland, which runs Inverness Museum, Mr MacMillan researched his family's history and was able to add new details to what he already knew about his grandmother. She and various members of her family went on to settle in and around Kilmorack, near Beauly, and Achnagart in Glen Shiel. Those who worked with Mr MacMillan in the research were Anne Fraser, family historian at the Highland Archive Centre, and Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum. Jim Hunter, emeritus professor of history at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an author of books on the clearances, also assisted in researching the significance of the Croick Decanter. To mark the relic's donation an event will be held at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery on 27 August. Prof Hunter will deliver a talk called Indelible Characters: Relics and remnants of Highland Clearance times. Starting in the late 18th Century and running into the 19th Century, the Highland Clearances saw townships occupied by generations of families cleared to make way for large-scale sheep farming and the rearing of deer. Landowners were seeking to \"improve\" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming. In some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished. The clearances have influenced the stories of two new films. Slow West, a Western starring Michael Fassbender and Kodi Smit-McPhee and written and directed by Scotsman John Maclean, opened in UK cinemas in June. Its plot features a clearance based on forced evictions in Wester Ross. The second film, a new short, will tell the story of Kate McPherson, who was among 80 people cleared off land in Sutherland and emigrated to Canada where they were settled in the Red River colony. Once in Canada, they had to walk 100 mile (161km) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes. Sutherland-born composer Robert Aitken is in the process of making the short film, Last Footsteps of Home.

The 31 year old, who has 100 previous convictions, was told she must serve three years in prison. Sentencing her, Mr Justice Treacy said it was \"an horrific crime\". Speaking in court on Monday, he said the victim \"must have suffered terribly\". Mr Girvan was found dead at his Greenisland home in County Antrim. He was virtually naked, bound and gagged on 18 January 2016. He had been stabbed in the chest and suffocated after being gagged with kitchen roll and a tie to stop him calling out for help. The court had heard previously that either injury could have killed him. The court was told that the pair, who had known each other for some years, had argued over money for sex. Henderson-McCarroll said she had been acting in self defence and \"poked\" her victim with a cake knife after Mr Girvan came at her with a stick sword. She said she had not meant to kill him and admitted that she had been high on crystal meth and heroin at the time. After the stabbing, Henderson-McCarroll admitted taking more heroin \"to calm her nerves\" before stealing Mr Girvan's car and driving it to Belfast. She was involved in an accident at Custom House Square, Belfast which led police to find Mr Girvan's car at the city hostel where she had been living. She was later arrested on an unrelated bench warrant and found to have a sat nav, a watch, and two sets of car keys in her possession. The sat nav contained Mr Girvan's home address and, after several attempts to contact him at home, police broke in and found his body. Henderson-McCarroll has 100 previous convictions for robbery, theft and assault. The court heard she had bitten, punched and head butted elderly men, young women and children in the course of past crimes. A doctor's report stated that she had lived a \"chaotic life\" of drug addiction, alcohol abuse, crime and prostitution. The court was told that she relapsed into heroin and crystal meth addiction after the death of her baby daughter. She also previously admitted eight other charges connected to Mr Girvan's killing: * Theft; * Attempted theft; * Aggravated vehicle-taking causing damage; * Dangerous driving; * Driving when unfit through drink or drugs; * Driving without insurance; * Failing to stop at an accident * Failing to report an accident For those crimes, she was sentenced to between one month and a year in prison - all to be served concurrently with her manslaughter sentence which was six years - three to be served in prison and three on licence.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A woman who killed a pensioner while \"high on crystal meth and heroin\" has been given a six-year sentence.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of $80,000 (\u00c2\u00a362,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for \"lone-wolf\" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: \"Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. \"The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect.\" Guns account for less than 1% of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless, the volume being sold \"can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies\", said the report. The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: \"In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. \"The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Criminals and terrorists are using the so-called dark net to buy weapons, a new study has suggested.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: In a study on mice, Hsp90 inhibitors were found to strip cancer cells of defences against hormone treatments. This makes the drugs particularly promising for treating drug-resistant cancers, the research team said. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK. About one in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives. It mainly affects men over the age of 50. The cancer can sometimes be treated successfully with hormone treatments, which target androgen receptors linked to the growth of male hormones called androgens. But some prostate cancers don't work that way. Instead they create an abnormal form of androgen receptor which is not linked to the growth of hormones and therefore does not respond to standard hormone treatment. This is the most common form of resistance in prostate cancer which leads to aggressive, difficult-to-treat cancers. The latest research, published in the journal Cancer Research, found that a new class of drugs reduced production of both receptors. Professor Paul Workman, study author and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said it was an exciting discovery. \"We call Hsp90 inhibitors 'network drugs' because they tackle several of the signals that are hijacked in cancer all at once, across a network rather than just a single signalling pathway. \"These drugs can hit cancer harder than those targeting only one protein, and look promising for preventing or overcoming drug resistance.\" Prof Workman said the next step was to test the Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials on patients with aggressive, drug-resistant prostate cancer. Prof Johann de Bono, a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research, said: \"These drugs are already in clinical trials for several types of cancer, and I am excited that our work suggests they could also benefit men with prostate cancer who have otherwise run out of treatment options.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A new type of drug could benefit men with aggressive prostate cancer that is no longer responding to treatment, researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) says teachers need more training to help them identity and protect girls at risk. At least 66,000 girls and women in the UK are believed to be victims of FGM. Campaigners say girls are most at risk of undergoing the procedure during the long summer holidays. The ATL, at its annual conference in Manchester, passed a resolution to lobby politicians to eliminate the practice and to develop resources to advise teachers and support staff on how to tackle the problem. Proposing the motion, Helen Porter, from Berkshire, said school staff should openly discuss the issue with parents. \"Schools and education staff can help by opening discussion with parents, and scrutinising holiday requests and summer holiday plans from members of communities that practise FGM. \"They should be vigilant for the signs of FGM such as frequent toilet visits and pain whilst sitting down. Schools should publicise the NSPCC's FGM helpline to pupils, parents and staff. \"We must aim to empower girls by discussion in age-appropriate PSHE [personal, social and health education] lessons delivered by trained teachers. \"We must equally empower boys to challenge this practice. Do they want this for their sisters, daughters, girlfriends or wives?\" Ms Porter said the practice of FGM should never be described as female circumcision, as there was no medical benefit and rarely any anaesthetic used. She said the term female circumcision was \"equivalent to describing deforestation as rainforest topiary\". Ms Porter said: \"FGM is child abuse. It is a violation of a child's human rights, and according to the United Nations is a cruel, inhumane and degrading torture that should be eliminated.\" Tendai Mashapure, from Cambridgeshire, said: \"We need to commit ourselves to the creation of an enabling environment where individuals are empowered to make decisions based on the best interest of their children. \"FGM will not end only by targeting those who practise FGM, but rather by engaging with all families, focusing on youth who will be future parents and targeting the leaders who have influence over community members. \"In other words, by reducing the demand for the practice, it will eventually become obsolete.\" ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: \"Teachers have been put in a position of great responsibility. What they need now is clear guidance on how to fulfil those responsibilities. \"They need a clear system for reporting their concerns.\" Dr Bousted welcomed the letter that Education Secretary Michael Gove sent to schools last term, urging them to protect girls at risk from what he described as \"this very serious form of child abuse\". FGM includes procedures that remove or injure female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility, mental health problems, complications in childbirth and increased risk of death for newborns.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The unnamed man was stopped at Turin Airport wearing a pilot's uniform and using forged ID cards, police said. He was charged with endangering air transport security and impersonation. The suspect led police to a garage containing neatly pressed white shirts with epaulets, black trousers and jackets, like those worn by pilots. No motive for the man's actions was reported immediately. Police have established he sat as \"third pilot\" in the cockpit of an Air Dolomiti plane which flew from Munich to Turin in April. He did not touch the controls, however. Air Dolomiti is part of the German airline Lufthansa, which gave no details when approached by the Associated Press news agency but insisted he could not have boarded the plane without a ticket. Investigators are now trying to establish if the man flew on other planes. Police had long been investigating the suspect, who had allegedly created a fake identity as a Lufthansa pilot named Andrea Sirlo, complete with a Facebook page which included fake flight attendant friends. They said they had been alerted several months ago after he introduced himself as a captain to a civil aviation lieutenant, who became suspicious because he seemed too young for the job. Police tracked him down from photos on his Facebook profile, in which he is apparently shown posing in uniform and sunglasses in front of planes. Officers approached him in a bar outside Turin Airport's check-in area, dressed in a pilot's uniform with no company logo on it, and sipping coffee. In the garage, officers also found fake IDs and fake flight theory manuals, the Italian news agency Ansa reports. \"On at least one occasion in 2012, pretending to be a pilot of a foreign commercial airline, and with a fake name, he succeeded in flying as the third pilot in the cockpit,\" police said in a statement. According to Ansa, a flight took place on 6 April. In addition, a profile on a website where users can track their flights also shows a \"Pilot Andrea Sirlo\" flying from Munich Airport to Turin on 23 October last year. The case has echoes of the 2002 Hollywood film Catch Me If You Can, in which Leonardo Di Caprio played Frank Abagnale, a real-life con-man who flew as a fake Pan American pilot in the 1960s. Sirlo is the name of a flight corridor over Turin.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Police in Italy have arrested a jobless man who posed as an airline pilot, tricking his way into riding in the cockpit of at least one jet.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said the last government had made progress on the issue, but more had to be done. He agreed parents should be responsible for making sure children speak English. Conservative MP for Keighley Kris Hopkins asked if the PM agreed that there was \"a responsibility and an obligation\" on parents to make sure their children can speak English when they start school. Mr Cameron replied: \"I completely agree... in too many cases this isn't happening.\" Since last autumn, people from outside the EU applying for a visa to join their spouse or partner now have to prove they have a basic command of English before their application is approved. Previously, visa applicants had to show only that their marriage or partnership was genuine and that they could financially support themselves.

{"article": "###\nArticle: What did the court say? Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work. On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day. The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive. I'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected? Possibly, yes. Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as \"mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected. Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category. As many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC. And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds. I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office The ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says. There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office. I have to commute two hours every day to my office For those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the \"overwhelming majority\" in the UK. I think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours? The ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account). That could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up. It could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum. \"I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have,\" Mr Tutton said. We have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling. Here is a selection of their comments: This is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester I am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge I am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon I currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow I am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford I'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our \"pickup\" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset I am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley I'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere.

They said parents had been taken by surprise by the government's decision to reopen schools with only four days' notice and many were not prepared.

The reopening of schools in Guinea comes four days after the UN said the number of confirmed Ebola cases in the country had fallen to its lowest weekly total since August. At one school in the Guinean capital, Conakry, only about 220 of the approximately 2,000 pupils were reported to have returned. Of the 36 teachers, more than half were back at work. Many schools have introduced health precautions, including hand-washing and temperature checks. Ebola has had a severe impact not only on public health but also on the Guinean economy. Unemployment and underemployment have risen, leaving many parents with difficulties meeting school-related expenses at the beginning of a new academic year. Schools remain closed in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the two other countries hit hard by the Ebola outbreak.

Shares also plunged on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes all down more than 3% by the close. Only one company on the FTSE 100 saw gains on Friday - Royal Mail, which rose by 1.6%. The FTSE 100 has fallen for nine sessions in a row, its longest losing streak since 2011. It is almost 13% below an all-time high hit in April. In the US, the S&P 500 suffered its biggest daily percentage drop in nearly four years on Friday, losing 64.8 points, or 3.19%, to 1,970.89. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.12%, and the Nasdaq dropped 3.52%. As well as global stock markets, US oil prices also dived on Friday, with New York crude dipping below $40 a barrel for the first time since the financial crisis and marking its longest weekly losing streak since 1986. Earlier, data from China indicated factory output in August shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years. The private Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 47.1 from 47.8 in July. A figure below 50 indicates contraction. The data triggered another sell-off in Chinese shares, which ended the day down more than 4%. The decline comes on the heels of weaker-than-expected economic data in July, plus this month's yuan devaluation and a stock market plunge. Investors are growing increasingly concerned, as the Shanghai Composite index is now down 12% this week. Friday's factory output reading for China was the lowest since March 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis, and the sixth consecutive below the 50-point level. The Caixin flash PMI is the earliest economic measure of the Chinese economy to be released each month and is closely watched for clues on how growth is faring. Earlier in August, China's official economic growth data showed a further slowdown in the past quarter, expanding 7% compared with a year earlier, its slowest pace since 2009. In 2014, China's economy grew at its slowest pace since 1990. It expanded by 7.4%, missing its annual growth target of 7.5% for the first time in 15 years. Since June this year, stock exchanges on the mainland have seen extreme volatility, undermining investor confidence and leading to government intervention. Nicholas Teo, market analyst with CMC markets, warned that China's slumping economy could dash hopes for a global recovery. \"China today is no longer just the 'factory' of the world. It is an important consumer of the world's products and services. Many companies and industries depend on the Chinese consumers who are now 'disadvantaged' in purchasing power,\" he said. \"So when it sneezes', many around the globe may just catch a cold.\" Greater China economist Julia Wang at HSBC warned that economic recovery continued to lose momentum with \"further policy-easing measures, from monetary easing to fiscal support needed\". But other analysts warned against overreacting to the current situation. AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver described the situation as a \"global share market correction\", pointing out that emerging markets were \"arguably much stronger than in 1997-98, with stronger current account balances and higher foreign exchange reserves\". Beijing has struggled to stabilise the country's stock markets, which have fallen sharply since mid-June. Earlier this month, the central bank stunned global markets by taking steps to devalue the country's currency, the yuan, allowing it more freedom to fluctuate in line with market developments. The move was widely seen as an attempt to prop up the country's ailing export sector, making Chinese goods cheaper abroad.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "London's FTSE 100 index has recorded its biggest weekly loss this year after poor manufacturing figures in China exacerbated global economic fears.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He was sentenced to life, but has been taking part in a pre-release scheme. The prison service said the Victim Information Scheme (PRVIS) gives victims an opportunity to provide and receive information about prisoners. Miss Fleming went missing in April 1998. Her body parts were found under the foundations of a partially-built house eight weeks later. Sentencing Scott in 2000, the judge described him as \"thoroughly evil\". He said: \"The manner in which her body was disposed of after her murder is surely the most gruesome. \"I am satisfied that you, Scott, not only deliberately killed this young girl but that you planned that killing and carried it out in circumstances so squalid that they would revolt any right-thinking person.\" Her sister, Josie Fleming, told BBC Radio Foyle she was contacted by someone who had spotted the killer painting a fence. \"Even though we knew the time was coming we are angry and fearful,\" she said. \"They need to let us know when he is due for his official release - it's important for us to know when this evil person will be free to walk the streets.\" Miss Fleming said she believes Scott is \"capable of anything\" and should never be freed. \"He took her into his flat, he tied her up in a bed and put a blindfold over her eyes and covered her mouth with tape,\" Ms Fleming said. \"He injected her with insulin and when she passed away he put her in the attic and then took her down and put her in the bath to cut her up.\" \"You never can come to terms with what happened, we're learning to live with it but we'll never, ever get over it.\" In a statement, the prison service said those who register with the Victim Information Scheme will get details about a person convicted of a crime against them.

The fact that Putin who is guarantor of constitution doesn't stop Kadyrov - means it's some kind of silent encouragement at least.\" Putin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors' Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally Mr Kasyanov, who served as President Putin's prime minister from 2000 to 2004, now leads Parnas, a small liberal opposition party. He and other Russian opposition politicians have described the sniper video, which appeared after the Chechen leader called Mr Putin's critics \"enemies\" and \"traitors\", as a murder threat. \"They want to intimidate us and continue to create pressure on the opposition,\" Mr Kasyanov said. \"The main purpose is pressure on the opposition. To make fear. So that we stop our active policy.\" He described Mr Kadyrov as \"one of the most outrageous pieces\" of the current Russian political system. \"Like all people in Russia, we should all be worried about what is going on,\" Mr Kasyanov said. \"But we've chosen our way and we have to stand up and continue to do our job.\" The former prime minister argued that a campaign of intimidation was under way because the Kremlin feared the opposition speaking out about the economic crisis and other issues. \"That's why they are afraid of us,\" he said. \"Because we will describe  who is responsible for the problems of the people.\" Instagram said the controversial video had \"violated the requirement to respect other members\" of the social network. Mr Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya with an iron fist for nearly a decade with the support of the Kremlin, suppressing separatism, accused Instagram of bowing to US pressure. In a new Instagram post, he said he had been punished for saying a \"few words about the USA's guard dogs\". \"You can write anything you want, but do not touch America's dogs, friends of the Department of State and Congress,\" he said. \"You know very well whom I am talking about!\" Last March Mr Kadyrov spoke out on Instagram about the assassination of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov in Moscow, defending one of the Chechens charged over the shooting.

{"article": "###\nArticle: But there was nothing expected about the way his Manchester United side claimed their first away win of the season. \"If Arsenal had scored in the first 20 minutes then it is a different game,\" said the United boss. \"And then maybe I have to respond to all the questions asking why I chose the three centre-backs. But now I can laugh.\" The joke ended up being on Arsenal's attacking players rather than the unlikely trio of defenders that Van Gaal had picked - Chris Smalling, Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair - who surprisingly held out until Olivier Giroud's ferocious strike in stoppage time. Saturday evening's defeat was not the same old story for the Gunners either - they did not take the lead this time, for starters. And while we already knew that both teams are unlikely to mount a title challenge, there were still things to be learned from a game billed as the battle for fourth place. Media playback is not supported on this device It had taken United until the 85th minute to muster a shot on target, with Kieran Gibbs' bizarre own goal gifting them the lead before Wayne Rooney's late strike prevented the game finishing with that odd statistic. As well as his first away win as United boss, this was arguably the first win under Van Gaal that had been earned by his defence. Arsene Wenger was keen to point out that David De Gea was man of the match at Emirates Stadium but in truth the United keeper made a lot of saves he would be expected to make, rather than any truly outstanding ones. Or as Van Gaal put it: \"Most of his saves were from outside the area and from that distance the goalkeeper has more advantage than the player shooting.\" The biggest reason De Gea's recently dislocated finger was not truly tested was United's makeshift backline, something few people expected to be saying before this game when they saw the team sheet with the names of Smalling, McNair and Blackett on it. A fourth clean sheet of the season looked even less likely when one of the wing-backs, Luke Shaw, was forced off after 16 minutes to be replaced by Ashley Young - who according to his manager is not fully fit. At that stage, Arsenal were rampant and it seemed a case of when they would score, not if. But instead of collapsing, United stood firm. Smalling, who is not viewed as natural leader, marshalled the youngsters either side of him. In front of them, Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini added much-needed bite to midfield. Together they earned Van Gaal a win that moved his side up to fourth in the table - something he seemed surprised about when he was told. While United can - justifiably - claim to be making progress, the raw statistics demonstrate Arsenal are going backwards. A year ago, they beat Southampton 2-0 and were four points clear at the top of the table with 28 points from 12 games. Fast forward 12 months and Wenger's men have 11 points fewer at the same stage, and trail leaders Chelsea by 15 points. Yes, fourth place is still in their reach - United, in the last of the Champions League places, are only two points ahead. Framed like that, this campaign is not yet a disaster. Media playback is not supported on this device But after ending their trophy drought by winning the FA Cup, and following that up with a summer of heavy investment, Arsenal fans can be forgiven for thinking their title challenge should have lasted longer than it did last season, when it faded in the New Year. Instead it is all but over before most people have put their Christmas decorations up. Some are making their frustrations heard - such as the Gunners fan in front of the press box on Saturday who held aloft a sign reading \"Enough is Enough - Wenger out\". But the majority remained with their manager on this occasion, perhaps because this defeat was unlike most of their setbacks this season. This time, it was misfortune that cost them the initiative in a game, rather than any ill-advised attempts to extend their lead. Gibbs' collision with Wojciech Szczesny that led to the full-back's own goal and ended the keeper's involvment in the game was pure farce. It would be unkind to compare the duo's actions to the antics of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the stars of new film 'Dumb and Dumber To' who were at Emirates Stadium to watch the game. But you get the feeling their characters Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne would definitely have approved. United's second goal was much more familiar to Arsenal fans, with their team being caught up the pitch and exposed on the break - but at least this time it was because they were chasing the game. Wenger's team have obvious shortcomings but they were not behind this defeat and his side did not get what they deserved against United. Instead it was just one of those nights.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Perhaps predictably, Louis van Gaal delivered the best line of the day as he reflected on how his side survived an early storm to beat Arsenal 2-1.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The deal will make JAB the biggest player in the North American single-serve coffee pod market. \"Keurig Green Mountain represents a major step forward in the creation of our global coffee platform,\" said JAB chairman Bart Becht, in a statement. JAB has invested heavily in the US coffee market. It bought Caribou Coffee Co and Peet's Coffee & Tea in 2012 and formed a joint venture between coffeemakers DE Master Blenders and Mondelez International in July. Keurig will continue to operate as an independent company after the purchase. Coca-Cola - Keurig's biggest investors- voiced its support for the deal in a statement. Coca-Cola will take a 17.4% stake in the new private company. \"We have enjoyed a strong partnership with Keurig Green Mountain, and will continue our collaboration with JAB in order to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the single-serve, pod-based segment of the cold beverage industry,\" said Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola's chief executive. Despite the higher cost of a single-serve coffee pod compared to a cup of filter coffee, the popularity of the machines continues to grow globally. According to Euromonitor International over the next three to five years, sales of single serve coffee pods are expected to grow by 5% in the US, 10% in Canada and 8% in Mexico. The research firm said the coffee pod business already accounts for 40% of the $15bn global coffee market. The business is not without its critics. The plastic pods have been criticised for increasing the amount of waste in landfills In March the creator of the K-cups, John Sylvan, told The Atlantic magazine he did not use the machine and acknowledged their cost and impact on the environment. \"I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,\" Sylvan told the magazine.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Keurig Green Mountain, which makes K-cups single-serve coffee pods, said it has accepted a $13.9bn (\u00a39.2bn) bid.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device It was physical, it was abrasive, it was what they talked about all week and what new head coach Eddie Jones said he wanted to get England back to. Jones said he was going up to Murrayfield to set the tone and leave with the win. He will go away happy and we will see a progression on what they did against Scotland over the next few games. The tactics were more route one, using the forwards. Centre Jonathan Joseph didn't really get the ball and the wingers mainly got it from kick returns so there is still a bit of finesse for England to put around the back line. The stats showed that England's set-piece was very good. Captain Dylan Hartley's line-outs were brilliant (England only lost one of their 15) and they were clinical. Jones has said he wants a strong set-piece game and he wants a strong, abrasive pack. They delivered that against Scotland. England also probably had two clear-cut chances to score tries and they took both of them. From that side it is all positives but I think Joseph will want to be in the game more. Media playback is not supported on this device His centre partner Owen Farrell wasn't in the game that much either and full-back Mike Brown wasn't his usual self. That will come but it is just going to take a bit of time. I am not massively sold on the combination of Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly-half and inside centre. If you have two number 10s who are out-and-out number 10s then both of them are spending too much time organising the game rather than carrying the ball. Farrell only carried the ball three times against Scotland and Joseph four. The midfield is not really functioning properly if that is happening. But at the same time, they linked up beautifully to put Jack Nowell in for a try. I would prefer an out-and-out inside centre who can also be a ball player rather than a fly-half playing there. At the moment it is a stop gap for England. I would prefer someone with a little bit more individual threat who can also do the distributing. Someone who is saying, \"I need to be in the game more\". Sometimes Farrell is trying to plan what England do and plot them around the pitch. George Ford needs to be doing that. Henry Slade is your dream but he is injured. He would have been the answer without a question of a doubt. At the moment they are having to do what they can with limited resources. England edged the breakdown in terms of numbers and in terms of actual turnovers. There are a lot of people in the England pack that can make turnovers with Dan Cole, Chris Robshaw, Joe Launchbury, James Haskell, Billy Vunipola and Mako Vunipola off the bench. I do hope England don't come up against an out-and-out specialist open-side flanker and get done again. We are not going to see that probably until we go to play Australia in the summer but it will be interesting to see what England do in the meantime. We still need to develop an out-and-out number seven. It will strengthen our game but someone has got to play well enough to keep knocking on the door. I judge intensity on the speed of your ball coming out from rucks and how fast people are getting into position to carry again. Media playback is not supported on this device England completely outworked Scotland in that respect. I also judge intensity on what a side does in defence - in terms of line speed in getting up to make a tackle. In the first half England were a bit off it but in the second half they were outstanding. They really led the line and outworked Scotland. From that point of view I think Eddie will be very happy. The scorelines might be similar between England's first game under Stuart Lancaster at Murrayfield in 2012 (a 13-6 victory) and this weekend but England had a lot more control this weekend. At the same time it can't really be compared. Stuart was creating a brand new team. He got rid of all the old guys and brought in loads of youngsters. Jones' team knew each other very well. I would give it a solid six and a half out of 10. Maybe a seven. There is still a lot of work to be done but knowing Jones and the workaholic nature he has got, he'll think the same.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "In terms of what England wanted out of the game with Scotland I think they got everything.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The world changed on 6 August 1945. Arguably, the appalling effects of that first atomic strike - and the subsequent attack on Nagasaki - have played a large part in the determination to prevent the use of far more devastating weapons developed since. Back then, the US was the only nation with \"the bomb\". The story since has been of the steady spread, the proliferation, of nuclear weapons: first to Russia, Britain, France and China - then to Israel (although never officially acknowledged), India, Pakistan, North Korea. The big powers seemed either unable or unwilling to prevent that spread except perhaps now - in the case of Iran. All sorts of conflicting signals are coming out of the international talks in Vienna meant to end all the hostility between the major world powers and Iran over its much disputed nuclear programme. There's talk of both breakdown and possible breakthrough. So why is it judged so important to stop Iran? I asked Sir John Sawers, chief British negotiator with Iran from 2003 to 2007, and after that the UK's representative on the UN Security Council when sanctions against Iran were being decided. He said: \"If Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, then it would change the dynamic across the Middle East. \"It would make them invulnerable to any response to their unacceptable behaviour in the region.\" Sir John told me: \"If there is an agreement then, first of all, it gives everyone much greater assurance that Iran is not going to make a break for nuclear weapons. \"It opens the possibility of Iran and its Arab neighbours coming together and developing a more normal relationship. \"At the moment, the Middle East is riven by disputes - many of them along Sunni-Shia lines - and if we can create a possibility whereby Saudis and Iranians can talk to one another and it is not driven by continuous hostility, then there is a possibility of creating a different sort of Middle East.\" It's not just August 1945 which hangs heavy over the negotiations with Iran. The events of February 1979 in Iran itself, and everything which has followed, help explain the years of suspicion and outright hostility between Tehran and Washington which a nuclear deal could do so much to ease. Ayatollah Khomeini's triumphant return to Tehran - on 1 February 1979 - from exile in Paris to take power as supreme leader of an Islamic Republic symbolises the moment when the US and its allies lost control of Iran with the fall of the shah. The years of blatant Western interference were over. Ruhollah Khomeini was born in Kohmeyn in central Iran. He became a religious scholar and in the early 1920s rose to become an 'ayatollah', a term for a leading Shia scholar. Arrested in 1962 by the shah's security service for his outspoken opposition to the pro-Western regime of the Shah. His arrest elevated him to the status of national hero. Exiled in 1964, living in Turkey, Iraq and then France, from where he urged his supporters to overthrow the shah. In January 1979, the shah's government collapsed and he and his family fled into exile. On 1 February, Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph. There was a national referendum and Khomeini won a landslide victory. He declared an Islamic republic and was appointed Iran's political and religious leader for life. Islamic law was introduced across the country. The new religious leadership inherited a nuclear research programme, but consistently denies expanding it with the aim of making \"the bomb\". The big powers have never accepted that, pointing instead to all the Iranian effort to produce highly-enriched uranium in the quantities you could only need to build a bomb, as well as the secrecy and alleged concealment of so much activity which is specifically outlawed by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory. Years of pressure applied by sanctions and negotiations to find a way forward have now reached a point where agreement could - just could - be possible. I spoke to Ariane Tabatabai, of Georgetown University, who, like me, has been in Vienna to follow what is supposed to be the endgame in these talks. She told me: \"Ultimately, the negotiations are about making sure that Iran's nuclear programme remains peaceful and to do that it needs to provide a set of assurances and that would mean Iran scaling back some of its nuclear activities. \"It will also provide more transparency to the International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure that everything is essentially under constant monitoring, with enhanced access given to its facilities so the international community can verify that Iran is holding its end of the bargain.\" Which brings us neatly to the unanswerable question: Is the Iranian leadership ready to make a bargain? It could be, partly to pacify those Iranians fed up with sanctions which help cripple their economy and symbolise isolation from a fast-developing world they yearn to be part of. Professor Ali Ansari, historian of Iran at St Andrews University, pointed me to another of the country's ambitions, which is to recover some of the global respect which Iran believes it is due. \"What the Iranians are after is a degree of respect as a country that considers itself a great power - certainly in the region - that has not had a good time in the last century or so. \"The real pride and achievement is that they have developed what they've considered to be an indigenous nuclear industry. \"One of the arguments many people have made is that an Islamic government wouldn't be scientifically advanced. \"Well for the Iranians, you know, this is, sort of proof that it actually can be, if they put their mind to it.\" But Prof Ansari is far from certain that a deal can be done, and - even if it is - that it will hold. And Sir John, from all his years negotiating with Iran, is blunt: \"Whenever you buy a carpet in Iran, you have to buy it two, three times over. \"You sometimes feel that is the same in the nuclear negotiations as well. There is an Iranian saying that the real negotiation only begins once the agreement is signed. \"They will always come back for more. Even if we get an agreement - it doesn't mean it is 'peace in our time'.\" So suspicion on both sides remains strong. Whatever happens in the next few days, building and then maintaining trust between Iran and the key world powers, particularly the US, is still the toughest of all the challenges.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "We're fast approaching the 70th anniversary next month of the dropping of the first nuclear bomb, on Hiroshima.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Garda\u00ed (Irish police) accompanied the former chief executive on the transatlantic flight and shortly after landing he was brought to a Dublin police station, and then escorted to the court. The hearing was told that Mr Drumm made no reply when police officers put the charges to him at the station. Sixteen of the charges relate to the alleged provision of unlawful financial assistance to 16 wealthy investors, in a bid to prop up Anglo's share price before the collapse. Mr Drumm moved to the US in 2009, the same year Anglo Irish Bank had to be bailed out by Irish taxpayers. Police objected to his bail application, claiming the accused is a potential flight risk. A sergeant told the court police believed Mr Drumm had the capacity to flee the jurisdiction and seemed to have access to large sums of money when required, despite owing millions in debts. A prosecution lawyer told the court the accused had fought tooth and nail against his extradition from Boston and had been leading the authorities a \"merry dance\" during the process. However, Mr Drumm's solicitor said his client had offered to surrender his passport, be tagged and sign on twice daily at his local police station. The defence lawyer added that the accused had offered to provide a \"relatively large\" amount of cash and had several family members who were willing to \"put their houses on the line\" so he could be granted bail. The judge granted bail on Mr Drumm's own bond of 50,000 euros (\u00a339,000) and two independent sureties of 50,000 euros. Mr Drumm ran Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 to 2008 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in the US. However, the bankruptcy bid failed and a Boston court ruled that he could be held liable for debts of 10.5m euros (\u00a38.34m). It was alleged during the bankruptcy case that the 48-year-old former bank boss secretly transferred money and assets to his wife, so they could not be seized during bankruptcy proceedings. Authorities in the Republic of Ireland issued an extradition request last year and he was arrested at his American home in October. At a hearing in Boston last month, Mr Drumm agreed to return to the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible. Bailing out the bank cost Irish taxpayers about 30bn euros (\u00a322bn: $34bn), close to one-fifth of annual output. Its downfall played a large role in the collapse of the Irish economy in 2008 and the ensuing bailout from its eurozone partners two years later.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "David Drumm, former boss of the Anglo Irish Bank, has been granted bail by an Irish court after he was extradited from the US to face fraud charges.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights. But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State represents a rare glimmer of hope. For the first time, the Burmese government is seeking international expertise to try and solve one of the country's most complex problems. It's a significant shift. For years, the official Burmese mantra has been that \"no foreigner can possibly understand Rakhine's problems\". Now Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been tasked with taking a fresh look at the issues as head of nine-member commission. His report could just add to the mountain of papers written about Rakhine and the Rohingya, or it just might be a game-changer. Will anyone help the Rohingya? Rohingya migrant crisis in 90 seconds The 'abandoned' people in Myanmar's election Aung San Suu Kyi where are you? So what's Aung San Suu Kyi up to? Well, first a cynical take. Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama. The Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn't doing more to help Myanmar's Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission. But there's more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn't have all the answers. Kofi Annan may be 78 but, as you'd expect from a former UN secretary general, he's his own man. The final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable. Almost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya's basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship. In Myanmar's current political climate it's hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She'd be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party. So Kofi Annan and his report could be the \"Trojan Horse\" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate. There are of course plenty of caveats. Problems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh. After the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there's been no real effort to help them return. Rakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa's apartheid. Things have become quieter but there's been little reconciliation. Whatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country. Vocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN. They're unlikely to welcome Kofi Annan's team, no doubt anticipating the sort of recommendations he might make. Implementing any \"solution\" will be even harder. But the formation of this advisory commission is something new. However small, it's the first bit of positive news that the Rohingya have had for a long time.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "There haven't been many good moments for Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims in the last four years.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: I think I've only ever had one or two hugs from Ivan - once after I lost my first Wimbledon final against Roger Federer, and maybe also when I won the US Open final. I don't think there was any hugging when I won Wimbledon. So it was with a straight handshake that we greeted each other at Queen's Club on Tuesday morning -  the first time we'd seen each other since the US Open last September. Media playback is not supported on this device We'd chatted occasionally over the past couple of years and I'd spoken to him a few times at the end of last year. I was just staying in contact, seeing what he was up to, and I knew he'd done some trials with other players so was interested to know if he was considering getting back on the tour. We know each other very well and it was good to have him back on Tuesday, it didn't feel strange at all. Getting a win over someone as good on grass as Nicolas Mahut was certainly a great start. Ivan is very clear and has strong opinions on things. That's important, I like that. I'd rather someone was very strong with what they're saying and, if I disagree, that's not a problem for him. He doesn't take it to heart. It's a bit easier to communicate when you don't feel like you're going to upset someone. I also enjoy his company and his sense of humour. He'll chat about pretty much anything. He's into his sports and has lots of good stories from when he was on tour. It was a bit different back then with Johnny Mac [McEnroe] and Jimmy Connors around. There weren't microphones and cameras everywhere. I'd say it was little bit more interesting in some ways. Obviously there are rivalries on the tour now but, from the stories that I've heard, I'd say the players today are a lot more friendly with each other off the court. It's important that Ivan and my other coach, Jamie Delgado, spend time together over the next few days. Ivan has arrived with his own clear ideas on what he thinks I need to be doing but one of his great strengths is he's a very good team player. It's crucial that he and Jamie see eye to eye. Ultimately I spend 40 weeks of the year with Jamie, and he also needs to believe and buy into the stuff that I'm working on as well. Jamie knows me well too, he's spent pretty much every day with me for the last three or four months, and that can help Ivan. So the two of them will chat about the things we need to concentrate on, especially this week on the grass. I'll be told before practice that this is what we're doing, I'll give a bit of feedback about what I might want to focus on, and we'll start work. I'm the number two player in the world by a decent distance in terms of ranking points, so I'm not playing badly, but the goals remain the same as ever. There are still things I feel I can improve upon, which I need to do if I want to get to number one in the world and try and win majors. I believe that Ivan, along with the other guys I'm working with, can help me achieve that. I think my team is very strong right now. I've been getting better over the past few months, I've improved some things, and hopefully I can get a few percent better over the next few months.

{"article": "###\nArticle: According to organisers a record 3.6 million turned out to vote in the Scottish independence referendum. More than 100,000 of the total were 16 to 17-year-olds who had registered to vote. Erin Fyfe McWilliam, 16 said: \"I'm glad the government thought we were able to make decisions for our country.\" She thinks it's put young people in the spotlight: \"Usually the older generation see us as being the 'tallywags' who don't care about politics at all. \"But I do think this referendum has taught the younger generation a lot about politics.\" A survey, commissioned by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, said 71% of 16 to 17-year-olds voted for Scotland to be independent and 29% voted against. So even if the age-group contributed their political views, it didn't appear to influence the outcome. Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom after the \"No\" campaign won. The Scottish referendum was a one-off for 16 and 17-year-olds, after the Scottish Parliament passed legislation allowing it to happen. But for years youth campaign groups have been trying to get the UK voting age lowered, arguing you can get married at 16 and pay your taxes, so why not vote? Gaelan Miller 17, who voted in the referendum, agreed that he didn't have that much life experience but said that shouldn't matter. \"Sometimes I think young folk like me can be influenced by your parents and we don't have mortgages,\" he said. \"But that's not to say we can't look at statistics at what's happened before with mortgages and ask your parents questions.\" The Lib Dems are all for 16 and 17-year-olds voting and promised it in their 2010 manifesto. Labour leader, Ed Miliband, also backs lowering the age. UKIP are against it, the Green Party is for and the Scottish National Party (SNP) is in favour as well. David Cameron and the Tories oppose it, so until all the parties agree to debate the issue it's unlikely to happen. Senior Lib Dem minister and Scottish MP, Danny Alexander, told Newsbeat he believes young people \"bring a freshness to the debate and ask important questions\". He said: \"I've always believed that 16 to 17-year-olds should have the vote. \"Some of the best debates and discussion I have had about the Scottish referendum have been with young people in schools and Newsbeat's Big Debate.\" But when asked about lowering the voting age before the next General election in May 2015, he was less optimistic. \"Not every party wants that so that we will have to look at that. We need to build a consensus across all parties for that happen. So we could have debate the constitutional changes in the UK,\" the chief of the Treasury said. \"All parties have to agree to do that. But I think the time has come for reform.\" 17-year-old Erin added: \"It's a bit disappointing being given this opportunity, then being told a few months down the line you have to wait a few years. I think it should be changed so that 16 and 17 year olds can vote.\" In the last general election in 2010, fewer than half of all 18 to 24-year-olds voted, which was much lower than the national average.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device Now, he has to find a replacement for the German as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton. And at this late stage of the year, it will be no easy task. So who will be on Wolff's shortlist and how likely are they to get the seat? This is the fight many would like to see. Hamilton and Alonso are regarded as the two towering talents of their generation and their intense battle as McLaren team-mates in 2007 was cut short by Alonso falling out with boss Ron Dennis and leaving the team. They ended that year tied on points, one behind world champion Kimi Raikkonen, with four wins each. Round two would be the biggest box office F1 could hope for, but it is highly unlikely to happen for two reasons: 1) Alonso is under contract to McLaren and even if he has a break clause - which they say he does not - they would not want to let him go; 2) More importantly, Wolff knows that the problems he had with Hamilton and Rosberg would pale compared to the potential difficulties of handling Hamilton and Alonso. Chances of it happening: 6/10 The Australian was the choice of many observers as the driver of 2016, and Wolff is a big fan. The on-track battle with Hamilton would be intense, but Ricciardo is a laid-back character and would probably be easier to handle off it. But he is under contract to Red Bull until 2018. Red Bull says they have no intention of letting him go, but if Wolff approached them there is just the possibility that they may consider selling Ricciardo. Why? Because most accept that, long term, Ricciardo and Max Verstappen is not a sustainable line-up - if Red Bull become title contenders their relationship is very likely to become incendiary. Chances: 6/10 Verstappen is the big rising star of F1. Shaded by Ricciardo over 2016 as a whole, performances such as his stunning drive in the wet in Brazil last month mark him out as a future world champion. Wolff would be very interested but, like Ricciardo, Verstappen is under contract to Red Bull - in his case to the end of 2019. And Red Bull are even more in love with the Dutchman than they are with Ricciardo. Chances: 4/10 Vettel's love affair with Ferrari - and vice versa - is long over after a difficult and disappointing season. Relations with team boss Maurizio Arrivabene are frayed - especially since the Italian said the four-time champion should focus more on his driving and needed to \"earn\" a new contract beyond 2017. And Vettel was unhappy with the decision to split with technical director James Allison in the summer. Likewise, Ferrari have been confused how, after a year and a half of easily beating team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, Vettel's form slipped in the second half of 2016 - although they might want to read the previous paragraph for an answer. Vettel has been shopping around for a move and would almost certainly welcome a switch to Mercedes. But there are some problems: 1) his contract runs to the end of 2017 and there is no obvious replacement for Ferrari; 2) he might not fancy going up against Hamilton; 3) Vettel and Hamilton together is almost as much of a recipe for trouble as Hamilton and Alonso. Chances of it happening: 8/10 Wolff has a long relationship with Bottas as part of his management team and rates him highly. The Finn has impressed in the last four seasons with Williams and would be a low-maintenance choice. He would deliver solid results on track and is calm and would not rock the boat off it. Next year is the last year of his contract at Williams. The team is not the most flush with cash in the pit lane and Wolff would almost certainly be able to put together an attractive deal - either for a cash payment to release Bottas or a reduction in Williams' engine fee. But Williams have an 18-year-old rookie in the well-resourced Canadian Lance Stroll in their other car next year and need experience in the lead car. Wolff could offer them Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein, who raced for Manor in 2016, in exchange. But would Williams accept? Felipe Nasr, who raced for Sauber in 2016, would also be an option for them, and please F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, who needs a Brazilian in the sport to satisfy its largest single TV audience. Chances: 9/10 The German is the obvious choice - he is Mercedes' reserve driver, he has tested for the team several times, and he is a free agent. But he has only one season's race experience, and although he has put in some promising drives, he has had a few shaky ones as well. Putting him in a race-winning car with Hamilton as his team-mate would be a big ask. And that's without even considering his personality. Insiders say Wehrlein can be difficult and self-centred, and Wolff will be wary of putting such a character alongside Hamilton. Chances: 8/10 Another Mercedes young driver, Ocon has impressed in his half-season alongside Wehrlein at Manor - so much so that Force India picked him rather than the German as their second driver alongside Sergio Perez for 2017. But Ocon has only nine races under his belt and it's surely too early for him to get a seat at the factory Mercedes team. Chances: 7/10 A left-field choice, the Scot has been out of F1 for two years now. But he was Williams reserve driver this year and is a Mercedes-contracted driver in the DTM German Touring Car Championship and would be a solid option. Chances: 5/10 Button has retired from F1, but remains contracted to McLaren. He made it very clear in the last few weeks that he needed a break from the sport. Chances: 1/10 The German has just signed a three-year deal with Renault, but the French company and Mercedes have links on a corporate level and Wolff is close friends with their racing boss Frederic Vasseur. But taking Hulkenberg would leave Renault with a vacancy that would be tough to fill and Wolff is not overly enamoured with him either.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The team at King's College London say smokers are more likely to develop the disorder and at a younger age. Published in the Lancet Psychiatry, their analysis of 61 separate studies suggests nicotine in cigarette smoke may be altering the brain. Experts said it was a \"pretty strong case\" but needed more research. Smoking has long been associated with psychosis, but it has often been believed that schizophrenia patients are more likely to smoke because they use cigarettes as a form of self-medication to ease the distress of hearing voices or having hallucinations. The team at King's looked at data involving 14,555 smokers and 273,162 non-smokers. It indicated: The argument is that if there is a higher rate of smoking before schizophrenia is diagnosed, then smoking is not simply a case of self-medication. Dr James MacCabe, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's, said: \"It's very difficult to establish causation [with this style of study], what we're hoping that this does is really open our eyes to the possibility that tobacco could be a causative agent in psychosis, and we hope this will then lead to other research and clinical trials that would help to provide firmer evidence.\" Clearly most smokers do not develop schizophrenia, but the researchers believe it is increasing the risk. The overall incidence of the condition is one in every 100 people normally, which may be increased to two per 100 by smoking. The researchers said nicotine altered levels of the brain chemical dopamine, which has already been implicated in the psychosis. Prof Michael Owen, the director of the Institute of Psychological Medicine at Cardiff University, said the researchers had made a \"pretty strong case\" that smoking may increase the risk of schizophrenia. \"The fact is that it is very hard to prove causation without a randomised trial, but there are plenty of good reasons already for targeting public health measures very energetically at the mentally ill.\" The charity Rethink Mental Illness said: \"We know that 42% of all cigarettes smoked in England are by people with mental health problems, and so any new findings about the link between smoking and psychosis is a potential worry. \"However, longer-term studies are needed to fully understand this potential link.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Smoking could play a direct role in the development of schizophrenia and needs to be investigated, researchers say.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Lord Carey writes in the Daily Mail that he has dropped his opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill \"in the face of the reality of needless suffering\". But the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has called the bill \"mistaken and dangerous\". Peers will debate the bill on Friday. Tabled by Labour peer Lord Falconer, the legislation would make it legal for adults in England and Wales to be given assistance ending their own life. It would apply to those with less than six months to live. Two doctors would have to independently confirm the patient was terminally ill and had reached their own, informed decision to die. Some 110 peers are already listed to speak when the House of Lords debates the private members bill on Friday. Insisting it would not be \"anti-Christian\" to change the law, Lord Carey said the current situation risked \"undermining the principle of human concern which should lie at the heart of our society\". He added: \"Today we face a central paradox. In strictly observing the sanctity of life, the Church could now actually be promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope.\" When Lord Carey was still the Archbishop of Canterbury he was among the opponents of Lord Joffe's Assisting Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, which was successfully blocked in the House of Lords in 2006. But in his article in Saturday's Daily Mail Lord Carey said: \"The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering.\" He said it was the case of Tony Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome and died after being refused the legal right to die , who had had the \"deepest influence\" on his decision. Mr Nicklinson's widow Jane, said Lord Carey's switch was \"huge\". \"I'm amazed actually and thrilled because the Church has always been one of our greatest opponents,\" she told BBC Radio 5 live. \"Someone shouldn't be forced to stay alive with daily suffering - his life was a living hell.\" There's been something of a shocked reaction to what Lord Carey said. Let's remember he's a former archbishop. He still has some influence in the Church, especially among the more traditionalist minded Anglicans. So what he said really will have some consequences. He'll also have some influence presumably in the House of Lords, having argued in the past strongly against similar legislation. One of the most telling things about what Lord Carey has said is that he now thinks it's not \"un-Christian\" to allow people to take their own lives when they're suffering at the end of their lives. It speaks to a body of people, including in the Anglican church, who now feel they can to some extent re-interpret what it is to be Christian, to be Anglican and how to put that into practice in their everyday lives. To hear that coming from a stalwart defender of biblical truth like Lord Carey is pretty significant. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 5 live that Lord Carey \"makes the point that it's not anti-Christian to support the change in the law that my bill proposes\". \"I believe it reflects the view of almost everyone in the debate that - whatever view you take about the issues - nobody wants people who are properly motivated by compassion to be prosecuted. And he puts those arguments incredibly powerfully.\" However, the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned Lord Falconer's bill would mean elderly and disabled people coming under pressure to end their lives. \"What sort of society would we be creating if we were to allow this sword of Damocles to hang over the head of every vulnerable, terminally-ill person in the country?\" he wrote in the Times. \"It would be very naive to think that many of the elderly people who are abused and neglected each year, as well as many severely disabled individuals, would not be put under pressure to end their lives if assisted suicide were permitted by law. \"It would be equally naive to believe, as the Assisted Dying Bill suggests, that such pressure could be recognised in every instance by doctors given the task of assessing requests for assisted suicide. \"Abuse, coercion and intimidation can be slow instruments in the hands of the unscrupulous, creating pressure on vulnerable people who are encouraged to 'do the decent thing'.\" The 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison. The law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation. There have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected. The Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a \"strong case\" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales. But the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society. In other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council. Campaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit. The Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Reverend James Newcome, said Lord Carey's comments would not influence any vote by bishops in the House of Lords. \"The general synod has debated it and come to a conclusion. That's the position to which we're sticking.\" But Lord Carey did received support from Rabbi Jonathan Romain, an inter-faith leader for campaign group Dignity in Dying. He said the experience in the US state of Oregon - where assisted dying became legal in 1997 - showed \"very few people\" would use the right to get help to end their lives. The Church of England said in a statement that its governing body, the General Synod, had passed a motion on the issue in February 2012. The motion reaffirmed the Church's \"support for the current law on assisted suicide as a means of contributing to a just and compassionate society in which vulnerable people are protected\". And Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is the Speaker's chaplain in the House of Commons, said having an assisted suicide law would sanitise death. \"I just happen to believe that matters of life and death in that way is not for us to play with. There are lots and lots of vulnerable people out there... you cannot make a law that is going to have a serious impact on a majority of people.\" Dr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship said he was concerned about vulnerable people being exploited. \"We've got to think about the people who are going to feel a duty to end their lives so as not to be a burden to others. \"I'm worried about the disabled people, the depressed and elderly, who are going to be put at danger by this bill which really just has eligibility criteria and not safeguards.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey says he will support legislation that would make it legal for terminally ill people in England and Wales to receive help to end their lives.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He added: \"There were a whole host of things that made the season fairly inevitable in the sense it would never be anything like last season. \"They had a journeyman back four that was protected brilliantly by Kante. They were an ageing back four, who are a year older. \"All of a sudden they were on pre-season tours, playing Barcelona, travelling all over the world. They were not prepared for the new season and then the confidence aspect sneaks in.\" Former Leicester and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, said the club's struggles this season made Ranieri's sacking understandable. Speaking to Radio 4, he said: \"Going down would be a disaster for Leicester and I suppose the board have made a very brave decision. \"If they stay in the Premier League then they've made the right decision. A lot of people will say there's no sentiment in football, look at what he's done for the club, but he's had a lot of the season to get things going. \"There's obviously some reason why not. We're not privy to that - maybe the board are. Maybe there's unrest in the dressing room, who knows? Maybe the players just aren't performing.\" Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha used social media platform Instagram to explain why he sacked Ranieri. \"We have done our best as management, we do not have only one problem to solve, but there are a million things to do to make our club survive, \" the billionaire wrote. \"Please respect my decision, I will never let the club down\".

It has gone sour this term with players underperforming, new signings not working out and baffling tactics at time from the Tinkerman. \"I thought they would get relegated with Ranieri in charge. I hated to say it. I hoped it wouldn't come true and I'd be proved wrong. \"This gives them a chance. A different kind of chance to stay up.\" Phil McNulty, BBC chief football writer: It is almost the thought that dare not speak its name amid the wave of shock, outrage and disgust at Leicester's decision to ruthlessly dismiss the hugely popular 65-year-old, who won the hearts of all supporters with his good humour, class and dignity as he led the Foxes to the title. But is there actually method in what many see as the madness of the club's Thai owners? Leicester's fall has been more dramatic than anything they could have foreseen in their worst nightmares. A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday. After 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season. The difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous. Pat Murphy, BBC Radio 5 live I understand some influential players in the dressing room, who were part of the Nigel Pearson squad a couple of years ago, were making graphic contrasts with team spirit and the organisational qualities of Pearson compared with Ranieri this season. The club never really lost faith in Pearson this time two years ago. Despite the fact they were in the parlous position, the general feeling was that he had the dressing room and knew where he was going. He left in the summer of 2015 for different reasons - personal reasons associated with his son, who was on the staff. Quite clearly, Ranieri had lost a lot of key allies in that Leicester dressing room with long memories. On 7 February, Leicester issued a statement saying Ranieri had their \"unwavering support\". Sixteen days later they sacked the 65-year-old Italian, who had signed a new four-year deal in the summer. His departure came a day after the Foxes won praise for their performance despite losing 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 first-leg tie at Sevilla. \"Ranieri was told he was sacked on Thursday afternoon in Leicester once the team returned from Spain, but the suggestion is the owners decided before that defeat by Sevilla,\" said BBC sports editor Dan Roan. \"The decision was taken very reluctantly but the club's owners are desperate to avoid relegation and its consequences.\" Foxes vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: \"This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City. \"But we are duty-bound to put the club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be. \"Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skilful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City.\" Srivaddhanaprabha added: \"His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve. \"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign. \"But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games.\" A news conference with Leicester assistant manager Craig Shakespeare will take place at 13:00 GMT on Friday.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan at the scene says it is a race against time before officials bring in heavy machinery. He says the smell of decomposing bodies is making some rescuers ill. More than 350 people have died since Wednesday's disaster and hundreds more are missing. On Sunday, two more people were pulled alive from the rubble of the eight-storey building in the suburb of Savar as the rescue operation entered its fifth day. A group of about nine survivors was also located and teams were using light cutting equipment to try to reach them, our correspondent says. Water and food are being dropped through gaps in the rubble, he adds. But with hopes fading for those still trapped, officials plan to bring in cranes within the next few hours. The army officer co-ordinating the rescue, Maj Gen Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy, said they would try to save the nine people first by using light equipment. \"But if we fail we will start our next phase within hours,\" he said. This would involve heavy equipment including hydraulic cranes and cutters to bore a hole from the top of the collapsed building, he told reporters. He said they still aimed to recover survivors as well as bodies. \"In this stage, we have no other choice but to use some heavy equipment,\" he said. \"We will start it within a few hours. Manual operation and use of small equipment is not enough.\" On Saturday a total of 29 people were rescued from the destroyed Rana Plaza in the commercial suburb of Savar. Police have so far arrested three garment factory owners and two engineers in connection with the disaster. Factory bosses Mahbubur Rahman Tapas and Balzul Samad Adnan surrendered to police early on Saturday while Aminul Islam was arrested later the same day. Police said they had ordered an evacuation of the building on Tuesday after cracks appeared, but that the factories ignored them and were operating the next day. The municipal engineers are reported to have approved the safety of the building a day before it collapsed. The owner of Rana Plaza, Mohammed Sohel Rana, has gone into hiding although police are questioning his wife. Airport and border authorities have been alerted to stop him from leaving the country, reports say. One minister has alleged that Rana Plaza was built without permits. Thousands of relatives of missing workers are waiting at the site as survivors and the dead are pulled from the rubble. Police said 353 bodies had so far been found, 301 of which had been identified. A further 2,431 people are known to have survived. There is no official figure on the number of people still missing, but Akram Hossain, a deputy director of the fire service, said their chances of survival were \"diminishing by the minute\". The fire service's head of operations, Mahbubur Rahman, said the rescue effort was becoming increasingly difficult for emergency workers as survivors were losing their strength to call for help. \"There are many dead bodies but our top priority is finding those who may still be alive,\" he told AFP news agency. \"There are some survivors. We can hear their feeble cries or hear them talking to each other.\" Mr Rahman said rescuers were digging tunnels through the rubble with bare hands, drills and shovels because they feared heavier equipment could cause further collapse. \"Pillars and beams are the biggest problem. Sometimes, even if we can locate survivors, we can't reach them because of these beams. They take a lot of time to cut through.\" One of those who was rescued on Saturday, Merina Begum, said she and seven other workers had survived without food or water. She told AFP: \"When the rescuers brought juice, ice cream and cold water, it was the tastiest food I've ever had.\" Anger at the building collapse has triggered days of violent protests in Dhaka, although streets were said to be quiet on Sunday. Bangladesh has one of the largest garment industries in the world, providing cheap clothing for major Western retailers that benefit from its widespread low-cost labour. But the industry has been widely criticised for its low pay and limited rights given to workers and for the often dangerous working conditions in garment factories.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Rescuers are frantically trying to save about nine people located in the wreckage of a collapsed factory complex in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner assesses the victors' performance in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out of 10 for Derek McInnes' side. Didn't do too much wrong, couldn't do anything about the goals. Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst. In second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game. In team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor. Probably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club Wasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of. Not the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them. An opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind. Largely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of. Celtic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better. Whenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat. Not the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that. Won a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor. Expect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything. Barely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down. Had that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit. Fairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively. Was probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout. Strong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure. Attacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target. Man of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example. Solid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position. Always capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal. Scored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did. Probably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be. Probably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal. Not as sharp as he normally is but led the line well. Did what he had do after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield. Another who did his job well and kept the performance ticking over after coming on for Rogic. Didn't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but didn't do anything wrong.

{"article": "###\nArticle: His wife Marina can still recall the last time she saw him. He was smiling in what she recalls was a sad way. She said she would be back tomorrow. \"He suddenly just said 'I love you so much',\" she remembers. \"I said 'Yes, of course. I love you too'.\" But when she got home, she received a call from the hospital telling her to rush back in. She did not get the chance to speak to him again. As he lay dying in his hospital bed, Alexander Litvinenko had remained the trained operative he had always been and tried to recall for police every detail that might hold a clue to his poisoning. For the police, he was something unique - a living murder victim - a man who was going to die but had time to talk to them. So who did he hold responsible for the mysterious illness which was taking such a terrible toll on his body? \"Everything that happened to him and he was able to speak - able to sign - he said Putin was responsible for his death,\" his widow told the BBC. The public inquiry will examine the central question - who was responsible for what was described by a lawyer in a previous hearing as 'an act of state sponsored nuclear terrorism on the streets of London'? It was one of the most remarkable and sensitive murder cases in modern times. \"This inquiry was different from any other investigation that I've ever been involved in,\" says Peter Clarke, who at the time ran the Metropolitan Police Counter-Terrorism Command which handled the investigation. \"It was not only a murder inquiry but there were other key areas that we had to think about: public safety - over 40 sites of radioactive contamination in public places, on public transport, aircraft, offices, restaurants... And then there are the international dimensions, the diplomatic dimensions and the intelligence areas that came into this inquiry.\" Much is already known about the broad brush of events - that Alexander Litvinenko was killed by radioactive Polonium 210 and that two Russians, Alexander Lugovoi and Dimitri Kovtun, are believed by police to be responsible. They are believed to have administered the substance in a cup of tea at the Millennium Hotel's Pine Bar  in central London.  Both men, though, have denied any involvement. This inquiry may reveal new details of the trail of evidence, though - a radioactive trail which shows that the Pine Bar may have been the third attempt to kill Litvinenko. But one issue never publicly examined is that of motivation. Why was Litvinenko killed? And crucially - was it on the orders of the Russian state? That is one subject this inquiry will be looking at. Litvinenko was a former FSB officer who had become a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin, first in Russia and then in Britain where he eventually received citizenship. The inquiry was formally created in July 2014 after the government finally relented in the face of pressure from Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert Owen, a judge then sitting as coroner but now chairman of the inquiry. The inquest process had hit a major problem - the government had demanded that certain material be kept secret but there is no provision for that in an inquest. So both Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert argued that the inquest should be converted into a public inquiry in which material can be considered in closed session. The government at first resisted but Marina Litvinenko persisted with legal challenges even as her money began to run out. In July the government changed its stance. This was seen in some quarters as a reaction to worsening relations with Moscow. In the past there was suspicion that there was a desire to put the Litvinenko case to bed and get back to business but by last summer the crisis over Ukraine had changed Britain's perspectives on Russia and may have led to the decision to hold an inquiry which could look at the issue of state responsibility. At a pre-inquest hearing, lawyers for the inquiry said that the material in possession of the British government did establish a 'prima facie case' for the culpability of the Russian state in the death. But this may well be secret intelligence which will not come out in public evidence. One thing the inquiry will be unlikely to look at in open session is Alexander Litvinenko's relationship with MI6. At one hearing, a lawyer for the widow of Alexander Litvinenko said that her husband had carried out work for MI6 and had a dedicated handler or case-officer with the pseudonym of Martin. This, the lawyer argued, meant that the inquest needed to look at whether the British state failed in its duty of care to Alexander Litvinenko by failing to take sufficient steps to protect him - in other words, could it have prevented the murder? In the end that issue was ruled out of the final inquiry. It has been a long journey. I first interviewed Marina soon after her husband's murder when she showed a determination to uncover the truth. Speaking to her eight years on, she remains as firm as ever in that pursuit and still has confidence in the ability of the British justice system to deliver final answers, despite all the ups and downs on the way. The next few months will be the final test of that.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "For three weeks Alexander Litvinenko desperately tried to fight off the radiation that was destroying his body from within.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) gave \u00a320,000 towards the Lap of Wales Challenge. But the Wales Audit Office found the board breached its own rules and regulations in handling the funding. Board officials said they would learn from the experience after auditors highlighted a lack of transparency and poorly-managed conflicts of interest. Auditors also found the health board failed to follow procurement rules when appointing suppliers for the event. The Lap of Wales Challenge was organised by Cerddwn Ymlaen under the leadership of its national organiser Eryl Vaughan and was fronted by the Welsh opera singer Rhys Meirion. The event cost more than \u00a3150,000 to arrange and the surplus was \u00a31,368. The challenge saw a number of Welsh celebrities undertaking a week-long journey through Wales in July 2015 to raise awareness of the Welsh Government's changes to the organ donation law. It was arranged in aid of Cronfa Elen. The fund was set up by Mr Meirion in memory of his sister who died in 2012, and was incorporated within BCUHB's own official charity, Awyr Las/Blue Sky in 2014. The health board awarded \u00a320,000 towards the event, with another \u00a320,000 coming from Cardiff and Vale Health Board and \u00a345,000 from the Welsh Government. The report found \u00a310,000 of BCUHB's contribution was awarded as a loan, but the paperwork was not processed by the health board's financial team. Despite that, the funds were transferred. Cerddwn Ymlaen said it was not aware it received a loan rather than a grant and would not have agreed to it, had it known. To ensure the Lap of Wales project was not in deficit, Cerddwn Ymlaen undertook additional fundraising to meet the \u00a3154,054 cost of completing the challenge. Concerns were also raised about a breach of the health board's financial regulations in relation to the challenge. A spokesperson for BCUHB said: \"The health board was very keen to learn from this experience which is why it asked the Wales Audit Office to carry out this review, as we recognise that to achieve the objectives of the charity, it is important to work with external bodies. \"Such arrangements are underpinned by trust, common objectives and mutual cooperation but misunderstandings can occur.\" Officials added a new joint-working protocol would provide a robust governance framework for future projects and require all arrangements to be formalised.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Auditors have questioned the way a health board handled funding awarded to a celebrity-led charity event.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

In the group of those who will be standing in Africa in 2017 is Donald Trump. Yes, I know it's an act of treason to associate him with Africa. But when he's sworn in as president, his foreign policy (or tweetplomacy) will have a bearing on our continent. His critics warn that his isolationist stand might mean less attention will be paid to Africa. But it could just force Africans to find solutions from within, by strengthening our institutions, improving infrastructure, governance and security and trading more amongst ourselves. Another man who also takes office in January is Nana Akufo-Addo, the president-elect of Ghana. He's tried to enter Flagstaff House (the presidential residency) through the ballot box as the New Patriotic Party candidate since 2008. Now that he has the keys, Ghanaians will wait to see how he delivers his pledge of one district, one factory, lest he becomes one man, one term. And then there's the state of emergency in Ethiopia, which still stands. It was put in place last October following violent protests. The government says the security situation has improved save for some clashes in the northern part of Amhara region. Some 9,000 people detained under the state of emergency have been released and the government says it could lift the emergency before its six-month period is over. There are two prominent men who will be kneeling before voters to ask for a job. Paul Kagame has been president for the last 16 years, but Rwandans appear to want more of him and have voted to remove the term-limit barrier. In August, Mr Kagame will therefore use his constitutional right to ask for a new employment contract. In the same month, his Kenyan neighbour Uhuru Kenyatta will also be reapplying for his job. Last September, while warning the main opposition leader Raila Odinga to mind his own party and leave the ruling Jubilee party alone, President Kenyatta famously said: \"\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 as you continue to search for a seat and salivate, we are feasting on the meat\". It will be clear in August whether Kenyans will give Jubilee more time to feast or turn the party itself into mince meat. Joseph Warungu: \"The Nigerian economy... enters 2017 in the squat position\" The African Union has been searching for a new Chief Executive Officer and will fill the position in January. Three men and two women from Botswana, Kenya, Chad, Senegal and Equatorial Guinea will fight it out to replace the outgoing South African Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, as Chair of the AU Commission. Now to some situations and people who can't decide whether to stand or sit. The Nigerian economy has caught its nastiest stomach bug in more than two decades. And so it enters 2017 in the squat position. A combination of factors including a crash in the global price of oil, which Nigeria relies a lot on, and a fall in the naira, the country's currency, contributed to the sizeable contraction of the economy in 2016. The anger and frustration among the people was aptly captured by this online comment from one Nigerian in November: \"We are now going into depression and deep S***! Buhari has himself to blame for unfortunately being a gentleman!\" Over in The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh is no gentleman - he's chosen to squat at State House. He lost the presidential election to Adama Barrow and publicly conceded defeat. A little later, the thought of leaving the seat he has called his own for the last 22 years overpowered him and he changed his mind. Africa and the world have asked him to go home, but he is defiant. As his last day in office approaches on 19 of January, the same force he used to gain power in 1994 could be used to relieve him of his office. There are three notable people who will be bowing out of office in 2017. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first elected female head of state in Africa, is coming to the end of her second and final term of office in Liberia. One of those waiting on the touchline to join the succession race is football star George Weah. The former AC Milan and Chelsea striker failed to score in the 2005 presidential tournament but hopes 2017 will be his year. Angolans will have a chance to replace the only man they've known as president for nearly 40 years. Although Jose Eduardo dos Santos has announced he'll step down, his blood will still flow through the veins of power and the economy in Angola. His daughter, Isabel, heads Sonangol, the state oil company and is considered by Forbes to be Africa's richest woman, while his son, Jose, is chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, Fundo Soberano de Angola. In neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, 2017 could mark the beginning of the end for another family dynasty, which started in 1997 when Laurent Desire Kabila became president after overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko. Laurent Kabila's son Joseph picked up the reigns after his father's assassination in 2001, and was bent on staying in power until attempts to change the constitution to allow him a third term backfired. Violent street protests have piled pressure on President Kabila to exit from office this year and the issue is bound to continue into the new year. The theme of falling is alive in South Africa. The #FeesMustFall campaign by university students sought to fight the rising cost of higher education and saw violent clashes between police and protesters, disruptions in the university calendar and the arrest of a number of students. 2017 promises more of the same because not only have the fees not fallen, some top universities have announced an 8% increase. And then there's the question of the country's President Jacob Zuma. In December 2017, his tenure as leader of the governing ANC party runs out, but his term as the country's president only ends in 2019. Allowing Mr Zuma to continue as head of state but with the ANC under someone else's leadership could create two centres of power, which could be political suicide. So will the ANC #LetZumaFall as it did President Thabo Mbeki under similar circumstances? 2017 will have answers. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is another that could face the threat of falling in Africa if more African countries continue to withdraw from the Rome Statute. A number of countries have notified the UN Secretary-General of their intention to withdraw, saying the ICC unfairly targets African leaders in its application of international justice. And now to international trends where fashion, like history, has a habit of repeating itself. A quick glance at catwalk signs for 2017 shows that the hems of women's skirts will be falling - to just below the knee. Apparently midi-skirts elongate the figure and flatter the wearer, so this must be a good fall. The Africa Cup of Nations tournament kicks off in mid-January in Gabon and Uganda carries the hopes of East Africa. The region has a terrible record in continental football. Uganda's last appearance in the finals was in 1978 when it lost to Ghana in the final. Kenya and Tanzania have never progressed beyond the group stage, so if Uganda can rise, East Africa can stand tall. In politics, despite all manner of socio-economic challenges, the spirit of the Africans is on the rise - they've already just about removed one long-serving president from power (The Gambia, even if he is still resisting ) and in 2017 a couple more might follow (DR Congo, Angola) When Africa stumbles, it must rise because as they say in Nigeria, the sun shines on those who stand before it shines on those who are sitting.

It is the second year in a row the oil company has reported a loss. In 2014, it reported a loss of \u00a32bn. Tullow also warned there was a risk it could fail to comply with its financial covenants this year. Financial covenants are agreements that companies make with their lenders to maintain a stable financial position. Oil prices have slumped by 70% since the middle of 2014, with many of the oil majors cutting back investment on exploration and production. That has also led to the loss of more than 5,000 jobs in the North Sea oil industry. Tullow said it could cut annual capital expenditure to as low as $300m in 2017, down from $1.1bn planned for 2016, if market conditions did not improve. The firm said it had reduced headcount of 37% and was on track to deliver cash savings of around $500m over three years. It also said it would pay no dividend in 2015.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Mobile measurement firm RootMetrics conducted over 840,000 checks, ranking operators for reliability and speed of voice, data and text services. While EE dominated for speed, Three was a close second in terms of reliability during last year's six-month study. Vodafone said it could not \"take the results of this report seriously and neither should our customers\". Evidence suggested some tests were \"carried out in an inconsistent manner\", it added in a statement. O2 ranked second in the speed index, but its reliability score was lower than that of EE or Three in the tests. Each operator was rated out of 100 in a range of categories - overall performance, call performance, mobile internet, text, network reliability and network speed. EE performed best across all categories, with Three second in terms of mobile internet, text services and network reliability. Source:  RootMetrics O2 came second in the call performance and network speed categories. Vodafone was last in all categories other than network speed, where it beat Three. Average speeds for networks were not given because they ranged so vastly from area to area, RootMetrics said. Neither did the study offer details about network coverage and mobile hotspots, although consumers can look at individual network performance at street level via its coverage map. EE said the results showed it gave \"customers everywhere in the UK the best mobile experience\", partly because of its investment in new 4G services, greater 3G capacity and upgrades to 2G networks. Three said the study was \"carried out prior to our launch of 4G at no extra cost, so is not up to speed with our current performance\". Rootmetric's tests saw data scientists cover a 23,000-mile area of the UK, including urban and rural locations, with 1,000 indoor tests. They used off-the-shelf Android devices, which had the testing software installed on them. Rootmetric's Bill Moore said the aim of the testing was to get as close to a consumer experience as possible, across a range of metrics. \"It is all very well to test speeds, but if you can't get on the network then the speed becomes irrelevant,\" he told the BBC. Futhermore, he said that while all networks faced the issue of dropped calls, it was a much bigger problem in the UK than in the US, where the firm has also been conducting tests. \"Networks here have a 2% failure rate compared to 0.5% in the US,\" he said. Matthew Howett, an analyst with research firm Ovum, said that EE's win in this particular study represented a return on huge recent investments in coverage. \"Clearly, EE scores very well and this reflects both their strategy of wanting to continue to be one step ahead with their network and the money they have put behind it,\" he said. \"While Vodafone doesn't score so well in comparison, they shouldn't be written off. \"They too have ambitious plans for network upgrades which are being delivered through 'Project Spring'. However, for the rest of the industry to close the gap on EE in terms of network speeds and availability, it is not going to be without a struggle.\" Mr Howett added that consumers may want more detailed information from future surveys. \"I suspect many will be looking for this specifically broken out for 4G network performance as they are being enticed to upgrade by their operators,\" he said.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Like a sort of officially sanctioned graffiti, the initials of the housing department of Rio de Janeiro were sprayed on homes marked for demolition. Almost 900 families, many of which lived on Rua da Esperanca (Hope Street), were facing eviction because their houses stood in the way of the planned route for the Transolimpica bus rapid transit system (BRT). The extension of the BRT is part of the upgrades planned ahead of the 2016 Olympic Games, which the city is hosting. The new 25km (15 mile) rapid bus route is expected to carry 70,000 passengers a day. It will link Barra da Tijuca, which will host the athletes' village, to Deodoro, the venue for several Olympic events. Rio City Hall intended to relocate the families from Vila Uniao to small social housing apartments or offer compensation packages. But many residents did not want to leave their 30-year-old community. After two years of uncertainty and a small yet vocal campaign of resistance, they have managed to save it from demolition. Instead of running straight over the neighbourhood, the new $555m-bus system (\u00c2\u00a3370m) will now cut around Vila Uniao. This means only 191 families will need to be relocated, a 78% reduction in the original number of expected evictions. \"We're celebrating a lot because it was 900 families and now it's 191,\" said Robson da Silva Soares, one of those leading the resistance to the demolition of Vila Uniao. But the victory was bittersweet for the residents, who, in 2012, had been promised investment as part of an initiative to improve the city's poor neighbourhoods by 2020. Months later, the Transolimpica project was announced and along with it, the need to relocate hundreds of families. Many of the homes earmarked for demolition were bigger than the government-funded apartments residents were being offered, explained 68-year-old Francisco Gabriel. \"I've been here 20 years and if it's a choice between leaving for the [government-funded] Colonia Juliano Moreira apartments or staying here, I'd prefer to stay here,\" he said. \"The homes there are smaller.\" According to Rio City Hall, plans for the Transolimpica were redrawn to reduce the impact on Vila Uniao. \"We managed to get public land belonging to the federal government to alter the project and attend to the needs of the residents,\" a spokesman said. Rio City Hall said the project, while causing disruption to some, also had huge potential to improve the lives of locals by linking their neighbourhood to other public transport lines. \"The future corridor will benefit the population leaving a huge legacy of mobility: a fully integrated transport network with the Transoeste and Transcarioca BRTs already opened, and the rail network in Deodoro,\" officials said. But while the reduced number of evictions was welcomed by the majority in Vila Uniao, it did not satisfy everyone, leaving the community divided. Cintia Neves, who runs a lunchtime cafe in the neighbourhood, has lived here almost her whole life. The 26-year-old shares the house her late father built when she was six months old with her mother and brother. \"The vast majority [in the community] think the change is good but there are some who wanted to leave,\" she says, explaining that some homes in Vila Uniao were barely more than hovels. \"We are staying for now\" she said about her family. But even though the relief of those residents whose homes have been saved is palpable the new route is still likely to affect the community. There is the local football pitch, for example. The original plan spared it but the new project runs over it instead. Rio City Hall said it was in talks with the owner of a local football ground to provide a new pitch. There were also concerns that those moving to the new social housing would lose the community feel they enjoyed in Vila Uniao. \"I grew up in the community with my parents and four brothers,\" Mr Soares said. \"There's a market, a bank, a school. But the place where the families are moving to doesn't have any of this. They have to start everything again.\" Mr Soares said he and his fellow campaigners would not give up: \"My house was in the path of the BRT and now I don't have to leave. \"But even so, I will continue with the same fight because independent of me, we're fighting for residents to have their rights.\" And he is confident he can drive down the number of those facing eviction even further. \"We see the possibility of removing fewer still than 191,\" the 37-year-old electromechanical technician said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Nearly all of the chaotically built homes in the small community of Vila Uniao in the west of Rio have \"SMH\" painted onto their walls.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The regulator has agreed to increase the amount of weight graphite bricks at the core of the reactor at Dungeness B in Kent will be allowed to lose. The bricks, which degrade over time due to radiation, are vital for safety. The Office for Nuclear Regulation said it was a \"robust\" body but one expert accused it of \"moving the goalposts\". The nuclear reactor at Dungeness B would have breached the safety margin within months which could have forced the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to prosecute or even shut it down. The safety margins cover thousands of graphite bricks at the core of Britain's 14 elderly Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs). But the bricks, each about a metre in height, are both cracking and starting to lose weight due to decades of radiation, and that could affect safety. The current graphite weight loss limit for Dungeness is set at 6.2% but the regulator says when it reached 5.7% its operator, French power giant EDF, applied to raise it to 8%. Mark Foy, deputy chief inspector at the Office for Nuclear Regulation, said \"We will be in a position to agree that 8% limit within the next few weeks. Ageing is a nuclear safety issue\". As part of that ageing process the licensee was required to monitor and inspect the reactors regularly. Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: \"It doesn't feel good when we come up against limits and the first thing they [the ONR] do is to move the goalposts.\" Mr Foy stressed that the ONR was a \"robust regulator\" and due process had been followed. \"If we feel the evidence they [EDF] have supplied is robust and sufficient to underpin the 8% case then we will agree it,\" he said. The graphite bricks are integral to UK nuclear power stations and they act to moderate the nuclear reaction; it will not function without them. The bricks cannot be replaced which means they are being carefully monitored as the reactors age. They become damaged through years of intense bombardment by radiation and effects of the coolant CO2 on the material. A distortion to the graphite core could prevent the control rods being inserted, which shut down the reactor in an emergency. EDF said \"safety of the public and our employees is our overriding priority\" and the company took a \"cautious approach\" working closely with the regulator and they operated with \"very conservative safety margins\" and safety requirements were \"stringent\". But in shifting the graphite limit Dungeness can still run only until the start of 2020 but that is still three years fewer than EDF would like and it may have to request a second increase in the safety limit. Prof Paul Mummery, from Manchester University, agreed that the original limits were \"conservative.\" But he said the twin problems of graphite cracking and weight loss meant it may be \"uneconomic\" for EDF to keep all the 14 AGR reactors running in the long term because the regulator may insist on more inspections to demonstrate safety. \"They [EDF] are making good progress but I would not be able to say with absolute confidence that they will reach 2023,\" he said. It was an \"engineering judgement\", he said, but \"no one could be sure\". \"There was more weight loss than expected in Dungeness B and that has led to some uncertainty about the continued operation.\" The AGR reactors contribute about 15% of Britain's electricity, according to Prof Thomas. He said EDF wanted the old AGR reactors to last until the planned next generation of nuclear power stations came on line after 2023 but said it was reaching a \"crunch point\". The old reactors might not last as long as EDF would like and there were still real doubts about the plans to build the new reactor at Hinkley C in Somerset.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A key safety limit at one of Britain's nuclear power stations is being raised to allow the life of the reactor to be extended, the BBC has learned.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Cecil, the lion he shot, was a massive tourist attraction and famous in Africa for being relaxed around humans. Mr Palmer said he thought the hunt was legal and didn't know the lion was protected. Cecil's death has prompted a huge reaction from many on social media, with tens of thousands of people signing a petition asking for Cecil's killer to be punished for what he did. Hunting lions is not illegal in Zimbabwe, and in many other countries in Africa, but hunters have to have special permits from the government allowing them to kill certain animals. Some people in Zimbabwe also argue hunting can have a positive impact. They say the money paid by tourists can be used for conservation and to create jobs for local people. I don't think people should hunt animals for sport, it's wrong and what did Cecil do to Walter in the first place? Nothing! It's not fair, money can't buy what that lion gave to us, love. If Walter can't see that he should open his eyes and see what really is important in life - money or love? Daisy, Monmouthshire, Wales I believe that it is a cruel sport that shouldn't be done anywhere because the killing of animals will increase extinction.

In my opinion if anyone would want to pay to kill an animal I would consider them 'sick in the head'. Ellie, Leeds, England I think it's wrong to hunt animals for sport because the hunter doesn't benefit from it and it's strange that someone gets a buzz from taking an animal's life.

Honor, London, England It is certainly not right to hunt animals for sport. How would the hunters feel if a lion chased after them with a weapon (or, of course, without - those teeth can be deadly anyway)? They'd be scared, stressed, and worried.

The inquest in Hull heard Mr Elliott had taken cocaine, ecstasy and temazepam before he drank the liquid. Mr Hockney was in bed asleep at the time and was \"completely unaware\" of what had happened, the inquest heard. The artist's former partner, John Fitzherbert, told the hearing he drove Mr Elliott to Scarborough Hospital in the early hours of the morning. Mr Fitzherbert said that in the day leading up to the incident, he and Mr Elliott had drunk alcohol, taken cocaine and smoked cannabis. Pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd told the court that temazepam and ecstasy were also found in his body. Dr Shepherd said the acid severely burned Mr Elliott's mouth, tongue and throat before perforating his stomach. Mr Hockney, who was not in court, said in a statement read out at the inquest that he had been asleep in his bedroom and woke up on the morning of 17 March to be told Mr Elliott had died. The 76-year-old artist said he had gone to bed at 21:00 GMT the night before and despite seeing Mr Fitzherbert and his chief assistant, Jean Pierre Goncalves De Lima, at midnight there was \"nothing out of the ordinary\". He did not see Mr Elliott before going to bed, Mr Hockney said. He said Mr Elliott and Mr Fitzherbert had been in a relationship for about four months and described how a number of people lived in his five-bedroom former guesthouse, including Mr De Lima. Mr Hockney said he had a large double bedroom where he also did portraits. He said Mr Fitzherbert had another large, self-contained room and they both led separate lives. He said he had known Mr Elliott for about 10 years and described how he helped him with all aspects of his studio work. But the artist said he only knew him \"professionally\" and he did not \"really know him in a social aspect\". He said Mr Elliott sometimes drank a lot and this gave him a \"Jekyll and Hyde\" character. \"I cannot comment on any of the lifestyle habits he has,\" Mr Hockney said in his statement. He said he had not been well at the time of the incident due to a mini-stroke. Mr Fitzherbert, who was present in court, described how he and Mr Elliott had spent the Friday night drinking and smoking cannabis. He said that on the Saturday morning, after Mr Hockney had left the house, Mr Elliott started laughing hysterically before jumping head first off a 9ft (3m) high internal balcony. Asked by the coroner, Professor Paul Marks, why he did this, Mr Fitzherbert replied: \"No idea\". He said Mr Elliott was not seriously hurt. \"I just saw his feet going over,\" he told the court. Mr Fitzherbert described how Mr Elliott later smoked more cannabis and they both fell asleep again together. He said he was woken by Mr Elliott in the middle of the night asking to be taken to hospital. Mr Fitzherbert told the court he found a bottle of toilet and drain cleaner in the sink but did not connect it to Mr Elliott at that time. Pathologist Dr Shepherd had told the inquest that Mr Elliott would have been in extreme pain and Mr Fitzherbert was asked repeatedly whether he noticed this as he tended to his friend. Mr Fitzherbert was also asked why he later called Mr De Lima to get him to tidy up the house. He said Mr Hockney had not been well and he wanted to \"shield him\" from any \"scandal involving drugs in his house\". Asked about why Mr Elliott did what he did, Mr Fitzherbert replied: \"I do not have any answers.\" \"I think he liked living on the edge,\" he said. Mr Elliott's mother, Karen Kent, told the inquest how her son met Mr Fitzherbert at a family barbeque when he was 15 years old. It was Mr Fitzherbert who introduced him to Mr Hockney. Mr Elliott's best friend, Christopher Towland, told the court he had recently become worried about his friend's gambling.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The 23-year-old crowdfunded her way to Rio to compete in the women's single sculls, but finished 20th in the finals last Saturday. However, six days later Snoop Dogg posted a photo of Ukogu on Instagram, telling his nearly 12 million followers that she had won a silver medal - Nigeria's first at these Games: We all have to admit that following the Olympics can be confusing, with heats and umpteen rounds before the finals. Ukogu did get through her heats, and made the quarter-finals, but needed to finish in the top three to progress to the semis with a chance of getting a medal. She came fifth in her race so was demoted to the \"C/D\" semis and final. In her \"final D\" race she came second, but her time of 7:44:76 put her 18 places below silver. What may have led Snoop Dogg up the garden path was a tweet last Saturday suggesting she had won silver for Nigeria: This then got picked up on Monday and was retweeted a bit: More of such tweets appeared on Friday - though it's not clear if this was before or after Snoop Dogg instagrammed. At the time of writing, his post had nearly 97,000 likes and more than 1,000 comments, some of which pointed out that it was not true - with others saying Ukogu was still impressive and made Nigerians proud. \"We have to celebrate her for the sacrifices and selfless service to the nation,\" posted Olufemisylvester. And there is no denying that Chierika Ukogu has made history. She is the first athlete to represent Nigeria in a rowing event at the Olympics. Known to her friends as \"Coco\", she raised $15,000 (\u00c2\u00a311,400) herself as she said the Nigerian Rowing Federation was not able to give her financial support. She was born in the US to Nigerian parents and became hooked on rowing at senior school. She continued to row at university - she plans to become a doctor. \"I put medical school on hold to dedicate my time to training,\" she said on her GoFundMe page. \"I hope that my athletic endeavours will inspire other Nigerians to take up rowing and experience the same joy I feel every time I'm on the water.\" Her enthusiasm is a soothing balm to what has been a bumpy Rio ride for Nigeria - Africa's most populous nation. The men's football team, playing for bronze later on Saturday, is Nigeria's only realistic medal hope. The footballers only arrived hours before their first match. They had been delayed in the US city of Atlanta because of problems paying for their flight. And Nigeria's Olympic kit only turned up a few days ago, after most athletes had completed their events. For the popular Nigerian actress Genevieve Nnaji, Ukogu's success was all about \"girl power\". Nnaji who also posted her praise on Instagram on Friday, but did not make the mistake about the medal. She said: \"She believed in herself, strangers believed in her.... That's how we change the narrative.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Department for Education (DfE) met the expense from its overall budget, says the National Audit Office report. \"The department was unprepared for the financial implications of rapid expansion,\" the authors say. The government said it made \"no apology for spending money on a programme that is proven to drive up standards\". In May 2010 there were 203 academies, which are publicly funded independent state schools directly accountable to the DfE and outside local authority control. The programme was started by the Labour government as a way to transform struggling schools. After the election the Education Secretary, Michael Gove, announced plans to allow all schools in England to convert to academy status. By September 2012 some 2,309 schools had converted, representing a growth of 1,307%, and 48% of secondary pupils were attending academies. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office (NAO), said the increase was \"a significant achievement - however the Department for Education was not sufficiently prepared for the financial implications of such a rapid expansion, or for the challenge of overseeing and monitoring such a large number of new academies\". According to the report, the department had budgeted \u00a37.3bn to set up and run academies in the two years from April 2010 to March 2012. It says officials were expecting some extra expenditure, to cover factors such as additional insurance, but were unprepared for the numbers of academies wanting to convert. In fact the total expenditure on academies amounted to \u00a38.3bn - \u00a31bn over budget. The \u00a31bn includes \u00a3350m paid to local authorities for temporary continued funding of places at non-academy schools, effectively double funding places while academies were being set up. The report says that to fund the expansion and remain within overall spending limits, the DfE had to find the money from other budgets, including the main schools settlement. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"We make no apology for the fact that more schools than even we imagined have opted to convert, and no apology for spending money on a programme that is proven to drive up standards and make long-term school improvements. \"We want as many schools as possible to take advantage of the significant benefits academy status brings because it means more schools run by great heads and teachers, not local authority or Whitehall bureaucrats, and more children getting a first-class education. \"The Department for Education has made significant savings in the last two and a half years and also set aside significant contingencies which have been set against the growth in academies. \"Additionally, the costs of converting academies have already fallen by 53% per academy. We anticipate further changes we are making will radically reduce costs in 2013-14 and beyond.\" Margaret Hodge MP, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: \"The decision to change fundamentally the nature of the programme away from one solely directed at struggling schools is up to the government, but taxpayers have the right to expect a more considered and controlled approach to public spending than the department has so far displayed.\" Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg called for greater scrutiny, oversight and local accountability \"to ensure school standards improve and the taxpayer gets value for money\". The figures also drew criticism from teaching unions with Mary Bousted, of the Association and Teachers and Lecturers, saying they showed \"only too clearly that the expansion of academies is being driven by political ideology and not by what's best for children's education\". Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"It is absurd for the government to justify spending \u00a38.3bn on academy conversions in two years while at the same time warning of a dire economic situation. Meanwhile, many good state schools are told there's no money as they stand in a state of disrepair with ever-diminishing support services.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A tenfold increase in the number of English schools converting to academies has meant \u00a31bn in extra costs, says the government's spending watchdog.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It's exciting, even for battle weary Scottish journalists, to see someone performing at the top of their game on a world stage with the potential to go further. That's not beyond Knox and the next two weeks provide the perfect platform for him to deliver further on his potential and achieve many of his dreams. Victory at the this week's Scottish Open in his home town of Inverness would certainly be one. That would push him right up the list for Ryder Cup qualification. Then there's the matter of next week's Open at Troon. Currently 27th in the world rankings, 131 places above the nearest Scot, Richie Ramsay, Knox is Scotland's best hope to at least fight for these trophies. He is a contender in most tournaments these days, primarily on the PGA Tour, and for a place in Darren Clarke's Ryder Cup team. As his star rises, Knox remains adamant that playing in front of an expectant home crowd over the next two weeks won't be a hindrance, despite heightened expectation. His demeanour backs that up. He seems philosophical - what will be, will be. \"It adds a little bit of pressure,\" he said. \"We're used to it, every week you've got pressure. I put a lot of pressure on myself every time I play so I don't really feel added pressure. \"I've been wanting to do this my whole life. I've been wanting to play on the PGA tour, European Tour, all the majors and hey, it's starting to happen. \"I've been wanting to win tournaments, be in the top 20, 10 in the world, see how high I can get. \"This is what I've been dreaming my whole life. I'm not sure if you're ever really ready for it but you've just got to do your best and go for it.\" There's a wider goal for Knox than doing well in his home country, or even achieving a dream Ryder Cup place. Getting into the top 20 or 30 players in the world is tremendously hard. Staying there is just as difficult, if not more challenging, and plenty of players have been there and fallen away. \"Of course the goal is to stay inside the top 50 but you have to play well to do that,\" said Knox. \"It's so hard to stay there. To be honest I don't know how I'm going to do. I could quite easily move forward or quite easily move back. \"That's the hard thing about golf. It's such a hard game. One week you feel like you can hit any shot, then up comes a week like last week when you're like 'Am I even good enough to play golf?' I feel like I can keep improving.\" Luke Donald addressed us shortly before Knox's arrival. He won this tournament at Castle Stuart in a rain-shortened Scottish Open in 2011, when he was the top-ranked golfer on the planet. He is now 83rd in the world and struggles to get anywhere near the form he showed so consistently. \"Luke is a great player, and he's just one example of someone who has been at the top and slipped down,\" said Knox. \"He's still a great player. \"It's so hard to stay there and this is really my first go at trying to stay there and trying to move up.\" Such awareness can only be a positive for Knox and perhaps helps to keep his head on the ground despite his success. \"The whole journey's been crazy the last couple of years. I just hope I never wake up and it keeps going.\" Victory here at home could be the launchpad for his life to get even crazier.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Russell Knox has every right to beam from ear to ear, as he did for the majority of his 15-minute media gathering, after flying in from his base in the United States to a sodden Castle Stuart.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Officers have found emails from Mr Bach to another senior IOC official Patrick Hickey, who was arrested last month and is facing charges. Mr Hickey, ex-head of the Irish Olympic Committee, denies all allegations. Police investigators in Rio told the BBC's Wyre Davies they would like to know what Mr Bach's influence was over Olympic ticketing policy. They said the IOC president received personal requests for hundreds of high-value tickets, for the Olympics opening ceremony, the 100m final and the football final from Mr Hickey. Police say that Mr Hickey received 296 tickets after his written request to the IOC president. They have not, thus far, made any contact with the president's office to request a formal interview. Mr Hickey was arrested during the Olympic games and spent time at the notorious Bangu high security jail along with fellow Irishman Kevin Mallon. He was released on bail at the end of August but had to return his passport to the Brazilian authorities and was ordered not to leave the country. A prosecutor laid charges against him on Tuesday. A judge will now decide whether to accept or reject the charges. Mr Hickey, 71, has formally stood aside as president of the Olympic Council of Ireland and European Olympic Committees' president during the investigation. Mr Mallon is the Dublin-based director of THG Sports, a corporate and sports hospitality company. Mr Bach cancelled a planned appearance in Rio this week at the opening of the Paralympic Games, for personal reasons. Mr Bach has not returned to Rio since the Olympics and missed the opening ceremony of the Paralympics at the Maracana on Wednesday. He said would remain in Germany for the funeral of his friend Walter Scheel, the former West German foreign minister and deputy chancellor, who died last month aged 97. IOC officials said Mr Bach would now not travel to Brazil after the funeral because he was unable to reschedule other commitments. The Paralympics run until 18 September.

{"article": "###\nArticle: She took power over the weekend following the death of 78-year-old President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in office after heading up the southern Africa country since 2004. Mr Mutharika's decision to appoint her as his running mate for the 2009 elections surprised many in Malawi's mainly conservative, male-dominated society - which had never before had a female vice-president. Equally surprising was her decision to publicly stand up to her boss - by refusing to endorse his plans for his brother, Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Mutharika, to succeed him as president in 2014 when he was due to retire. She was promptly thrown out of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party - and subjected to daily doses of derision at public rallies and on Malawi's state airwaves. A senior ruling party official openly said Malawi was \"not ready for a female president\", while First Lady Callista Mutharika said Mrs Banda was fooling herself that she was a serious politician - saying she was a mere market woman selling fritters. \"She will never be president, how can a mandasi [fritter] seller be president?\" Mrs Mutharika said. Mrs Banda took all this in her stride, saying she was glad to be identified with market women since more than 80% of Malawian women belong to that category: \"Yes, she's right, I'm indeed a mandasi seller and I'm proud of it because the majority of women in Malawi are like us, mandasi sellers.\" She also resisted calls for her to resign as the country's vice-president - she was elected not appointed so she could not be fired by Mr Mutharika - and instead set up her own People's Party. Born in 1950 in the village of Malemia near the southern town of Zomba, Joyce Hilda Ntila was the eldest in a family of five children. Her father was the leader of Malawi's police brass band and her youngest sister, Anjimile, ran pop star Madonna's charity Raising Malawi until it closed in December. She left her first husband in 1981, taking her three children with her, because he was abusive. \"Most African women are taught to endure abusive marriages. They say endurance means a good wife but most women endure abusive relationship because they are not empowered economically, they depend on their husbands,\" she told the BBC about her decision. Eight years later, Mrs Banda founded the National Association of Business Women, a group that lends start-up cash to small-scale traders - making her popular among Malawi's many rural poor. That work also earned her international recognition - in 1997, she was awarded, along with former Mozambican President Joachim Chissano, the US-based Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership for the Sustainable End of Hunger. She also set up the Joyce Banda Foundation, a charity that assists Malawian children and orphans through education - she has a degree in early childhood education. Joyce Banda cut her teeth in politics in 1999 when she won a parliamentary seat on the ticket of the former ruling United Democratic Front. She held a number of cabinet positions under former President Bakili Muluzi and Mr Mutharika during his first term. She puts her achievements down to her happy marriage to retired Chief Justice Richard Banda with whom she has two children. \"My dear husband, Richard, has been the driving force behind my success and rise to whatever level I am now. My story and legacy is incomplete without his mention,\" she said. Mrs Banda's presidential challenges are huge: Aside from handling political divisions and possible opposition from Mr Mutharika's allies, she has to address Malawi's serious economic difficulties. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 75% of the population living on less than $1 (60p) a day. And former President Mutharika fell out with most of Western donors - on which the country depends for financial support. The cutting off of direct aid resulted in the country's worst shortages of foreign currency, fuel and essential drugs. But she has immediately made her mark - sacking Malawi's police chief Peter Mukhito, accused of mishandling anti-government riots last year in which at least 19 people were shot dead, and Patricia Kaliati as information minister. In the wake of Mr Mutharika's death, Ms Kaliati had held a press conference saying Mrs Banda had no right to take over as president - despite what the constitution said. The head of Malawi's state broadcaster has also been replaced.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Joyce Banda, who has made history becoming Malawi's first female president and only the second woman to lead a country in Africa, has a track record of fighting for women's rights.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

And Forest Green were listed as being away to Wolves, who were in fact drawn at home to Yeovil. The live stream was also hampered by sound problems, with listeners on some clubs' websites unable to hear the draw. The EFL have since released a statement apologising for \"a number of third party technical issues that affected coverage of [Friday's] Carabao Cup round one draw in Bangkok\". It continued: \"There were inaccuracies - as a result of human error - in the live graphics output that resulted in confusion and incorrect ties being displayed on screen. \"In addition, some users did experience difficulties in accessing the stream on certain external platforms. Both issues are currently under investigation. \"The EFL can confirm that the draw was not compromised in any way and all clubs have received confirmation of their round one ties.\" There are 12 former League Cup winners in the first round, with five-time champions Aston Villa the most successful side entering at this stage, ahead of four-time winners Nottingham Forest. Villa have been handed an away tie at Colchester, while Forest host League One side Shrewsbury. Newport County were drawn at home to Southend United, but the match will take place at Southend's Roots Hall stadium so the Welsh club can finish work on their pitch. The final of this season's competition will take place at Wembley on Sunday, 25 February 2018. The full draw for the first round of the EFL Cup is as follows: North Section Coventry v Blackburn Nottingham Forest v Shrewsbury Bradford v Doncaster Mansfield v Rochdale Grimsby v Derby Barnsley v Morecambe Oldham v Burton Wigan v Blackpool Bury v Sunderland Sheffield Wednesday v Chesterfield Accrington v Preston Fleetwood v Carlisle Rotherham v Lincoln Sheffield United v Walsall Scunthorpe v Notts County Crewe v Bolton Leeds v Port Vale South Section Birmingham City v Crawley Town Exeter City v Charlton Athletic QPR v Northampton Town Newport County v Southend United Bristol City v Plymouth Argyle Cardiff City v Portsmouth Millwall v Stevenage Oxford United v Cheltenham Town AFC Wimbledon v Brentford Norwich City v Swindon Town Bristol Rovers v Cambridge United Peterborough United v Barnet Wycombe Wanderers v Fulham Colchester United v Aston Villa Wolves v Yeovil Town Reading v Gillingham Forest Green Rovers v MK Dons Luton Town v Ipswich Town\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Relegated Sunderland will travel to Bury in the EFL Cup first round.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

A female and a baby were retrieved on Sunday, and are already back at Symbio Wildlife Park, south of Sydney. Two men have pleaded guilty to charges of dealing with proceeds of crime. Brothers Jesse and Jackson George are not believed to have snatched the monkeys from their enclosure, but they were charged with trying to profit from the theft. Pygmy marmosets - the world's smallest monkey species - command up to A$5,000 (\u00c2\u00a33,000, $3,700) on the black market. Police found the men after a tip-off from the public. A desperate appeal for information had been launched by the zoo, amid fears that the baby marmoset would die within 48 hours if unable to feed from its mother. The four-week-old was found when the Georges' car was pulled over at Appin, southwest of Sydney. The female marmoset was found about 20km (12 miles) away in the Campbelltown area. Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph said the brothers had exchanged marmoset pictures with a third person via mobile phone, along with messages about how much a monkey could sell for. \"Ay, check out my monkey,\" wrote the third person, according to court documents. \"That's mad bro. Wanna sell it bruh?\" Jackson George replied. The baby marmoset is now home and well, said Symbio Wildlife Park, after they reunited it with its mother. \"Mum cradled the baby straight into her arms and bub immediately began to feed,\" the zoo wrote in a statement on Facebook. Police say they are continuing their investigation into the theft.

The alien world could give us more information about the formation of our Solar System. The find was made by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), which looks for young planets orbiting bright nearby stars. Our own Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system - it's so big you could fit over 1,300 Earths inside it! It's also the fastest rotating planet too, with 1 day only lasting 10 hours - but a year on Jupiter lasts for 12 Earth years. Jupiter doesn't have a solid surface and is made up of gas, giving it the name 'gas giant'. The baby Jupiter has the strongest methane gas signature ever found on an alien planet. The astronomers also detected water using the GPI's spectrometer instrument. Scientists hope that by studying far away worlds, they can learn more about how common the structure of our Solar System is. Astronomers believe the gas giants in our Solar System formed slowly - by building up a large core over a few million years and then pulling in a huge amount of hydrogen and other gases to form an atmosphere. This is known as a \"cold-start\". But the Jupiter-like planets that have been discovered so far are much hotter than scientists have predicted. Which could mean they formed quickly - as gas collapses to make a scorching planet in what is known as a 'hot-start'.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Astronomers have discovered a baby planet which looks like a young version of Jupiter.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He said he would not be seeking a fourth term in the 2017 election. Deputy Prime Minister Bill English is likely to take over until the National party holds a caucus to choose a new leader. Mr Key made the surprise announcement during his weekly press conference. He set a date of 12 December for the formal resignation. He said his job required great sacrifices \"from those who are dearest to me\" and that his children had coped with \"an extraordinary level of intrusion\". \"All I can say is that I gave it everything I had. I have left nothing in the tank.\" Referring to his wife, he told radio program Newstalk: \"We talked about it and she likes the concept of me being home more but there was no ultimatum.\" Mr Key, who was formerly at Merrill Lynch as a foreign exchange dealer, ended nine years of Labour Party rule in 2008 when he ousted Helen Clark as prime minister. He won a third term for the National Party at elections in September 2014. Opposition Labour leader Andrew Little said Mr Key \"has served New Zealand generously and with dedication.

Green Party co-leader Meteria Turei also wished him well. \"I fought every day against John's politics but always supported his right to be a dad and a husband first,\" she tweeted.

He has sought to build closer ties with the US, taking a leading role in supporting President Barack Obama's Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) - a 12 country trade deal covering 40% of the world economy.

It comes after Theresa May suggested Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not done enough to condemn abuse. The PM has called for parties to unite against \"bullying and harassment\". Since last month's general election, attention has focused on abuse suffered by MPs from across the political spectrum, including Tory Sheryll Murray who said she had faced social media comments like \"burn the witch\". On Saturday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said some of her party's supporters had targeted female Conservative MPs - as well as Labour members - with \"vitriolic abuse\". But ahead of the Parliamentary debate, Labour has levelled accusations against the Tories in a letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin from his Labour counterpart Ian Lavery and Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement. \"Parties and politicians have a responsibility to set an example, by treating others with dignity and respect, including those with whom we strongly disagree,\" they wrote. \"The Conservative Party has instead promoted personal attacks as a core component of its national campaign. \"Abuse against candidates on social media is completely unacceptable. The Conservative Party perpetrated this on an industrial scale by spending millions of pounds to post highly personalised and nasty attack adverts on voters' Facebook timelines without their permission.\" They claimed Labour \"fought a positive, hopeful campaign\" and insisted that all its MPs ran campaigns based on its policies rather than personal attacks. On Monday, Mrs May - asked whether Mr Corbyn was doing enough in response to complaints of intimidation - said she was \"surprised at any party leader who's not willing to condemn that\". Conservative Simon Hart has secured Wednesday afternoon's Westminster Hall debate on \"the abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections\". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics on Tuesday, Mr Hart said there had been a clear change in attitudes towards MPs and campaigners between the 2015 and 2017 general elections. People wanting to publicly support candidates were being \"driven away from politics at a time when we need them\" he said. \"This extends way beyond the so-called bullying of MPs, this is about online bullying generally,\" he said, claiming there had been a \"deafening silence\" from political leaders. Mr Hart claimed the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn-backing grassroots organisation Momentum had played a \"significant part\" in this shift. But Momentum dismissed his accusation as \"baseless\". \"If we are going to tackle the abuse MPs from across the political spectrum face, Simon Hart and other Conservative MPs should stop making baseless accusations for which they offer no proof, and instead think about how we can work together to find a solution,\" a spokesman for the group said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Labour has accused the Conservatives of putting \"vitriolic personal attacks\" at the heart of their election campaign.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

And it plans to expand operations across Scotland to address the social challenges of those with criminal convictions. The scheme has received \u00a3208,000 of Scottish government funding. The social enterprise company behind the project, Braveheart Industries (BHI), operates the airstream-style food truck providing training, mentoring and support for offenders who have made a commitment to change their lives away from violence and crime. It is supported by Police Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) BHI trades under the banner of Street & Arrow in a play on the phrase \"straight and narrow\", which often describes the aim of people with convictions. It is based on the successful Homeboy Industries Programme in Los Angeles, which has taken on more than 10,000 former gang members in an effort to make a positive change. The BHI social enterprise model was initially targeted at deprived areas in Glasgow, but Insp Iain Murray of the VRU said it is hoped to expand the idea across Scotland. \"There is a need in many locations. We would like to see this throughout the country,\" he said. \"These are guys and girls who deserve a second chance. If we don't give them a second chance, the risk is they become a risk to everyone else. \"So it's important to offer them hope and opportunity. \"They are keen to show they want to make amends, to be productive members of society and the community, to demonstrate to their families and their kids that this is the way things should be.\" One of the trainees working on the food truck, Leanne Bell, 27, has a history of drug and alcohol dependency, and has served sentences in the women's prison, Cornton Vale. She said she had now been clean for a year, and was happy that customers could see an ex-offender putting something back into the community. \"It's proof that you can change.

I have a place of my own and I'm paying the council tax, so I am contributing to society.\" Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said it was important that members of the public being served at the food truck know that offenders taking part must be free from drugs or alcohol dependence. \"This is a very good example of individuals who are seeking to turn their lives around by trying to get themselves into employment and put something back into the community. \"It's a facility which is well valued in the local community, it's well used, and it's also producing a very high quality and high standard of food and drink. \"What's important here is equipping these individuals with the skills to be able to move into employment in the future, and we know in the catering industry there are opportunities to move into that industry.\" BHI has operated with offenders at the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo since 2012, and in the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.

On Thursday, five white police officers were shot dead by a black man, Micah Johnson, during a protest rally. The march was against the killing of black men by police. Two deaths this week have led to nationwide protests. Dallas police said its officers - using dogs - searched the parking lot but the hunt turned up nothing. In a statement earlier on Saturday, the police said: \"The Dallas Police Department received an anonymous threat against law enforcement across the city and has taken precautionary measures to heighten security.\" An armoured vehicle was moved close to the main HQ in central Dallas and heavily armed officers were seen nearby, according to the Associated Press news agency. But it added that members of the public were still able to walk about freely around the building. The police asked media to stop all live feeds around HQ \"for the safety of our officers\", the BBC's James Cook reports. The shooting happened late on Thursday during the protest march. Johnson, who was himself killed during the assault, supported black militant groups who encouraged violence against police. Dallas police chief David Brown said Johnson had told a negotiator that he had wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers, because he was angry about the recent shootings of black men by police. The attack came after the police killings of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana. Earlier on Saturday, President Barack Obama said the US was \"not as divided as some have suggested\" in the wake of the shootings involving African-Americans. He said Americans of \"all races, all backgrounds\", including many of those who were protesting, were outraged by the Dallas killings. As well as the five police officers killed, another seven were injured on Thursday. Two civilians were also hurt. Johnson, 25, who officials say acted alone, was killed by remotely detonated explosives that were sent into a car park where he had taken refuge after the shootings. He was a member of the US Army Reserve from 2009 to 2015 who had served in Afghanistan. Bomb-making material, rifles and a combat journal were found in his home in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite.

Here we run through a few examples of the experiments on Samantha's 'to do' list... Samantha will operate a gadget called an electromagnetic levitator, which can heat metals to 2,000\u00c2\u00b0C and then cool them very quickly. This will be a chance to see what happens to different metals when they go from liquid to solid, without the effect of the Earth's gravity. It's hoped the results will reveal more about the physics of the metals and how they work. Samantha will be testing new machine technology and how well they work in space, such as this astronaut joystick. Using a joystick in space may feel very different in space compared to on Earth. So these experiments will see how being in space might affect how well an astronaut can control a space robot or space machinery. Another thing is that equipment may need to be attached to the astronaut so it doesn't float away. The testing will also see what impact this has. Samantha will be doing lots of experiments to see how being in space affects her body. For example, she will experience 16 sunrises and sunsets every day on the International Space Station and be tested to see how this affects her body clock. Another important subject is food and energy. Experiments to see how much food an astronaut would need for a long mission will be carried out.

And further questions about Team Sky's doping controls led MPs to claim its reputation was \"in tatters\". \"It shouldn't even need saying, but we all back Dave B 100%!\", Thomas tweeted. \"I've known him a long time and I wouldn't want anyone else leading Team Sky,\" the 30-year-old said. Peter Kennaugh agreed with Thomas, adding: \"I think all the riders on Team Sky would join me in saying they are completely behind Dave Brailsford.\" \"He's the leader of our super Team Sky,\" added Elia Viviani. Michal Kwiatkowski, Owain Doull and Luke Rowe also tweeted their support for Brailsford. It follows reports that some riders have lost confidence in Brailsford and considered asking him to resign. Brailsford has denied any wrongdoing, saying TUEs \"do not cross the line\" over performance-enhancing drugs. Last week a Parliamentary select committee heard evidence about the former Team Sky doctor who received a 'mystery package' for Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011, Richard Freeman. Team Sky responded saying that they were a clean team who abide by the rules. \"We are proud of our stance against doping. We believe our approach to anti-doping is rigorous and comprehensive,\" they said in a statement. BBC sports editor Dan Roan With the future of Sir Dave Brailsford - and perhaps even Team Sky - uncertain after months of damaging revelations, this is an attempted fight-back, with several riders closing ranks around their under-fire boss at the request of management. However, it has not escaped attention that the team's leading man, Chris Froome, is yet to make clear his support, instead tweeting about a meal he enjoyed in South Africa. And if that is an act of defiance, it could place even more pressure on Brailsford as he tries to cling to his job. Media playback is not supported on this device Freeman, meanwhile, has also received the support of a former colleague. Dave Readle, who was a sports psychologist at the governing body's high performance programme from 2008 to 2014, and worked closely with Freeman, told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that the doctor \"has been thrown under the bus\". MPs at last week's select committee hearing were told how Freeman had failed to keep medical records of treatments for riders - a possible breach of General Medical Council rules, according to the UK Anti-Doping Agency - and ordered large quantities of the corticosteroid triamcinolone, that may have outstripped clinical need. Freeman administered Wiggins' TUEs, and took delivery of the mystery medical package in France 2011. It has also been reported that fellow doctors at Team Sky blocked him applying for a fourth TUE for Wiggins, and that he was in charge of medical supplies when testosterone patches were delivered to British Cycling in 2011, apparently in error. He has denied any wrongdoing, and is thought to be preparing written submissions to Ukad's questions. Freeman withdrew from giving evidence to the select committee on the eve of the hearing last week due to ill health. But Readle said: \"Richard has been hung out to dry. He is a loyal friend, a man of honesty, integrity and loyalty, and this is a tough time for him. All this negative publicity, he's in a state of shock. \"The fact that no one's come out to support him, after all the help he's given riders, it stinks. \"I spent a lot of time with him and everything he did was above board, there was no cutting corners.\" When asked why Freeman may have failed to keep medical records, Readle said that the intensity of the workload while treating large numbers of athletes and other staff may have meant that the doctor's administration sometimes slipped. \"You get bombarded with stuff in elite sport, he wouldn't have done it deliberately.

The glasses will record up to 30 seconds of video at a time. As part of the announcement, Snapchat is renaming itself Snap, Inc. The renaming decision underlined the company\u2019s apparent ambition to go beyond the ephemeral messaging app, a product which is highly popular with young people. An article published by the Wall Street Journal on Friday showed Snap\u2019s 26-year-old creator Evan Spiegel in a series of pictures taken by  fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld. In an interview, Mr Spiegel explained his rationale for creating Spectacles. \"It was our first vacation, and we went to [Californian state park] Big Sur for a day or two. We were walking through the woods, stepping over logs, looking up at the beautiful trees. \"And when I got the footage back and watched it, I could see my own memory, through my own eyes - it was unbelievable. \"It\u2019s one thing to see images of an experience you had, but it\u2019s another thing to have an experience of the experience. It was the closest I\u2019d ever come to feeling like I was there again.\" On Saturday, Snap released some limited information about how the glasses will work. Footage will be recorded in a new, circular format which can be viewed in any orientation, the company said. The battery on the device will last about a day. A light on the front of the device will indicate to people nearby when the glasses are recording. Prior to confirmation from Snap about the product, news website Business Insider published a promotional video it found on YouTube showing the product. The video has since been taken down. Broken Glass Spectacles will remind many of Google Glass, an ill-fated attempt by the search giant to create smart glasses. While Google Glass did get into the hands of developers around the world - at a cost of $1,500 each - the device never came close to being a consumer product. The company eventually halted development, but insisted the idea was not dead. Though Glass was beset by hardware issues, perhaps its main flaw was the public perception. At worst, many saw it as troubling, privacy-invading technology. At best, others just considered it ridiculous-looking. However, with a far lower price point, and likely adoption by influential celebrities, Snap\u2019s Spectacles stand a solid chance of being seen as cooler than Google\u2019s attempt. \"If you look at the kinds of glasses millennials wear, the design is very \u2018in\u2019,\" suggested Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst from Creative Strategies. \"Making them sunglasses helps hide the camera better, but it also limits the usage somewhat - you\u2019ll need to be outside in daylight. She added: \"The name change is interesting as it would indicate a change in focus away from messaging, which with Spectacles makes sense. Snap is perhaps becoming more about life-logging, content generation and story-telling.\" According to the WSJ, Snap is not treating the device as a major hardware launch, rather a fun toy that will have limited distribution. \"We\u2019re going to take a slow approach to rolling them out,\u201d Mr Spiegel told the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s about us figuring out if it fits into people\u2019s lives and seeing how they like it.\" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Messaging app firm Snapchat has announced its first gadget - sunglasses with a built-in camera.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The Weald of Kent girls' grammar school wants to open an annexe in Sevenoaks. The Department for Education (DfE) is considering the plans which have the backing of Kent County Council. The law forbids the opening of new grammar schools, but changes made by the coalition government in 2012 allow enlargement of existing schools. \"I strongly support the right of all good schools to expand.

Sevenoaks is the only major Kent town that does not have grammar provision. Bids made in 2013 were turned down because the DfE said they did not comply with the law. But the current plans put forward by Weald of Kent girls' grammar school are believed to have met the criteria.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The officer said he found the black animal toy wearing an officer's shirt at a police station in central London. Scotland Yard promised to look into the matter but the detective was himself investigated for making the story up. He was later cleared at a misconduct hearing and received damages from the force after taking legal action. The details emerged after a separate case at Thames Valley Police in which an officer put a monkey on a black colleague's desk. A misconduct panel concluded last month that Det Sgt Andrew Mottau was not being racist but should have realised the toy animal could be offensive. The incident involving the Metropolitan Police began in September 2013 when the Indian-born detective constable claimed to have seen a large monkey toy in the office of the Case Progression Unit at Belgravia police station. He said the stuffed black toy had a police officer's shirt on and a label saying \"night-duty ERO\" - Evidential Review Officer. One of the EROs at the time was a black police officer. The detective was concerned the use of the toy was racist and had not been investigated properly. He raised the matter during a live internal website chat known as the \"Commissioner's Forum\", where staff are encouraged to discuss problems with the Met Commissioner, who at the time was Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. The detective received an online reply saying: \"What is described - if accurate - is unacceptable\" and was told that it would be looked into \"immediately\". But a month later, the detective himself was put under investigation for allegedly posting \"untrue and potentially inflammatory comments\". He was told his actions had \"breached the standards of professional behaviour... relating to \"honesty and integrity\" and \"discreditable conduct\", claims which, if proved, could have led to his dismissal Eventually, in June 2015, after protracted internal disciplinary proceedings, the officer attended a gross misconduct hearing where it was ruled there was \"no case to answer\" and he was cleared. Paul Turpin, who was a representative for the Metropolitan Police Federation and supported the officer through the process, said: \"I was surprised when the matter was referred to a gross misconduct hearing and was not surprised when that hearing found the officer had no case to answer.\" He suggested the allegation should never have got that far: \"Matters should be dealt with at the lowest appropriate level at the earliest possible opportunity.\" Scotland Yard said there had been an \"internal review\" of the handling of the case after the hearing. It said the original allegation about the monkey had been \"investigated locally and progressed as far as it could be\", though the inquiry was unable to establish who had placed the black toy animal in the police station. The Asian detective, who has not been named by the BBC at his own request, began legal proceedings against the Met at an employment tribunal alleging he had been racially discriminated against and victimised. But before a full hearing took place the force reached a settlement and agreed to pay damages. The details of the agreement are confidential but the amount of compensation is thought to be in the region of \u00c2\u00a335,000. The officer declined to comment and has not divulged any details of the agreement to the BBC. The Met confirmed a settlement had been reached \"following judicial mediation\" at the Tribunal Services in March 2016. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin, who is in charge of professionalism at Scotland Yard, said the force had made \"significant investment\" in improving the way it handled staff complaints linked to discrimination, bullying or harassment and had introduced a new \"whistle-blowing\" policy. \"We have long recognised that people... fear being victimised if they raise a complaint, regardless of whether that fear is justified,\" he said. \"That has never been acceptable and we continue to make it very clear to our staff that victimisation will never be tolerated, that it will be investigated, and will have serious repercussions if it occurs\". But Janet Hills, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, said the use of a black monkey toy and the treatment of the Asian police detective indicated there was still a long way to go. \"We're still trying to get rid of the dinosaurs in policing who are still protecting that culture\", she said, describing the \"monkey\" incident as \"unbelievable\" and \"unacceptable\". \"It's not just a toy, it's a toy to be used to say 'this is what I think of you',\" she said. \"It's racist and discriminatory behaviour,\" she said, adding that it went on because people thought they could \"get away with it\".

Since 1986, 176 journalists have been killed in the Philippines, one of the most dangerous countries for reporters. But Mr Duterte said many of them had \"done something wrong\". The former mayor of Davao was formally declared the next leader on Monday, after a landslide victory in May's election. He will be sworn in on 30 June. When asked about the high number of attacks on journalists, Mr Duterte said that \"you won't be killed if you don't do anything wrong\". Citing Jun Pala, a journalist, politician and critic of Duterte who was murdered in 2003, he said: \"I do not want to diminish his memory but he was a rotten son of a bitch. He deserved it.\" \"That can't be just freedom of speech. The constitution can no longer help you if you disrespect a person.\" The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said the comments were \"appalling\". \"Mr Duterte's crass pronouncement not only sullies the names and memories of all 176 of our colleagues who have been murdered since 1986, he has also, in effect, declared open season to silence the media.\" The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said the remarks \"give security officials the right to kill for acts that they consider defamation\". \"This is one of the most outrageous statements we have ever heard from a president in the Philippines,\" said CPJ's Shawn Crispin in Bangkok. The news conference was a typically strident appearance by the man nicknamed \"The Punisher\" for his strict criminal policies in Davao. Here are some of the other main points: Mr Duterte's popularity rests on his reputation as a crime-fighter. During his time as mayor of Davao crime fell sharply, but it also saw the rise of death squads and, according to rights-groups, at least tacit official approval of the murder of more than 1,000 people. Saying the new crackdown started \"now\", Mr Duterte promised to pay 3m pesos ($64,000; \u00c2\u00a344,000) to officials who capture suspected drug lords, If any law enforcement agent was \"messing around with drugs and it comes to a fight, I want you to kill him personally\", he said. Mr Duterte's new cabinet is mostly male - only two so far are women - and they were broadly seen as conservative choices. Perfecto Yasay, who has said talks are the only way to resolve the country's South China Sea disputes, was named foreign secretary. Mr Duterte's former schoolmate, Carlos Dominguez, was named finance minister, and economics professor Ernesto Pernia will be economic planning minister. More controversially, former marine Nicanor Faeldon was chosen to be head of the customs bureau. He led a coup attempt in 2003 and in December took a group of protesters to a disputed island held by the Philippines, to a furious response from Beijing. \"We have this pact with the West, but I want everybody to know that we will be charting a course of our own.\" Currently a staunch ally of the US and recipient of its protection, if not formal backing, in territorial disputes with China, Mr Duterte said the Philippines would no longer rely as much on Washington. The US State Department responded by saying it had \"no problem whatsoever\" with bilateral talks among parties to South China Sea disputes, but that most would not be solved that way. Mr Duterte said he was waiting for the results of the case The Philippines has before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, over disputed islands in the South China Sea. \"Then, with the advice of the cabinet, I might be able to proceed,\" he said. \"But you know, I am not ready to go to war.

{"article": "###\nArticle: It's perceived as the least corrupt country, with the longest surviving multiparty democracy on the continent, and boasts one of the world's fastest-growing economies. But, following the global economic downturn in 2008, and increasingly volatile commodity prices, the country's reliance on diamonds has come into question. For the first time Botswana finds itself cash strapped, in negative growth, and having to go to international donors. The country is looking to diversify its economy by strengthening existing sectors like tourism and cattle farming, and investing in burgeoning industries spawning from technology and entrepreneurship. Yet diamonds by far outshine any other industry in Botswana, accounting for one-third of GDP, 70% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues. However, production has peaked, and experts believe reserves of the precious stone may run out by 2030. Unemployment is also on the rise, with official jobless rates nearing 20%, and an estimated 45% of Botswana's population living below the poverty line. Economic growth was also negative in 2009, and the industrial sector shrank by 30%. Signs of labour unrest have also began showing following public sector strikes in recent years. As Linah Mohohlo, who has been governor of the Bank of Botswana for 15 years, put it in a recent interview with BBC Africa Business Report: \"It is a serious concern to government, for many years now strategies have been put in place to diversify the economy away from mining.\" In many ways Botswana is seen as becoming a victim of its own making. Policies have favoured and protected the diamond industry, and strategies and institutions that assisted and protected its growth for decades have made implementation and expansion of newer, alternative industries difficult. The strong role of the state in the economy, plus bloated bureaucracy, often also makes it difficult for investors to enter the market. Most contracts are also government sponsored, making it hard for entrepreneurs to set up shop and compete. Despite being in the relatively stable southern African region, an electricity crisis in South Africa, and political uncertainty in Zimbabwe makes it a bit of a rough neighbourhood. In response Ms Mohohlo says she's more worried about competition from the country's neighbours, especially for foreign direct investment, and says Botswana needs to \"sharpen its pencils\". The manufacturing industry, for example, has \"not done what we expected it to do\", she says. The sector accounts for an estimated 5% of Botswana's GDP, and employs more labour than mining. In addition, Botswana has a small domestic market of only two million people and having to compete head-to-head with South Africa is a challenge. Botswana needs to come up with unique enterprises to compete effectively with South Africa, says Dr Tebogo Seleka, executive director of the Botswana Institute for Development Policy Analysis (Bidpa). \"We are both in SACU (Southern African Customs Union), that means goods can enter freely, so if we chose those enterprises that South Africa is more competitive at, that puts us at a disadvantage,\" he says. The key to Botswana's future diversity, many believe, lies in private sector development, and attracting foreign direct investment. Dr Seleka also believes that due to the country's proximity, combined with its diminutive population, investors tend to set up shop next door. \"If a firm from overseas wants to locate in southern Africa, because of Botswana's market size we are at a disadvantage,\" Dr Seleka says. \"We also need to look at technology readiness, if you look at the types of technologies firms use, and the rate of adoption of new technologies in Botswana it is still not up to scratch.\" One of the solutions to beefing up diversity in the country's economy may lie with its most abundant animal population. Cattle outnumber the human population by over a million, and beef is the country's third-largest earner. But despite this, agriculture, in its entirety, only makes up 3% of Botswana's economy. Bakang Tsheboagae, a cattle farmer from Dutlwe, a village in the Kweneng District of Botswana, says the techniques his family have used for generations to manage their cattle herds have hindered his growth. Historically our way of tracking cattle are earmarks, which are identical, and you can only brand them once they reach a certain age,\" he says. \"Livestock multiply, and as you multiply it becomes so difficult to count them, or to know which one is where.\" Botswana's cattle and beef industry is driven by exports to Europe, and in order export their beef, farmers must produce traceability records. \"I would say whoever has livestock; small, medium or large scale, ultimately you need a tool that will help you account for whatever you are doing,\" says Mr Tsheboagae. Enter a new breed of entrepreneur, using technology to modernise the sector. Thuto Gaotingwe, 26, has developed cattle tracking software Modisar - named after the Tswana word for a herd boy. Mr Gaotingwe has managed to realise his vision through the help of a one of the government's new entrepreneurial incubators, the Botswana Innovation Hub. Known as a \"quasi government institution\", the innovation hub is described on its website as part of the state's \"national strategic goal for the diversification of the country's economy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 set up to support new ventures and existing companies.\" Modisar is a productivity software application that can be installed on a farmer's computer or laptop, and allows the farmer to capture information about his or her farm faster. Mr Gaotingwe explains: \"We are trying to say, 'look you can make money off livestock farming, only if you do it the right way'. \"So we have built Modisar, and it allows farmers to keep records of his farm assets. Then it allows farmers to know more about livestock diseases.\" Although criticised for being reactive as opposed to proactive, the government has implemented a number of policies, strategies and incentive schemes to encourage diversification. An Economic Diversifiation Drive (EDD), for example, has been implemented to strengthen the private sector. The EDD plans to leverage the government's purchasing power, estimated at $2.1bn (\u00c2\u00a31.3bn) per annum, to stimulate local production and consumption by buying from locally based manufacturers and service providers. Linah Mohohlo also explains that government has also begun exploring diversification options with in mining sector. \"You are now seeing other minerals, such as coal, uranium, copper, nickel coming on-stream,\" says Ms Mohohlo. Despite facing obstacles, with the right long-term developmental strategies, Botswana has huge potential to diversify.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "In Africa, Botswana is often seen as a diamond in the rough.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The child was then placed with 35-year-old Downer as the legal guardian in January 2015. Keegan was described in court as a \"healthy and happy baby\" and lived at Downer's family home in Beckbury Road, Weoley Castle. She collapsed at home shortly before 10am on 5 September 2015. When paramedics arrived, Downer had Keegan lying down on a sofa and told them: \"I don't know when she stopped breathing, because I was in the bath.\" Downer later told paramedics she had popped out and left the child alone during that morning. Keegan died from a combination of septicaemia, infection, blunt chest trauma and old head injuries. Of Downer, Mr Power said: \"We say there is no other realistic candidate for the many and terrible injuries that led to Keegan's death.\" The trial of Downer, who also denies causing or allowing the death of Keegan, continues.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A mother-of-four battered a toddler to death months after she was made the child's legal guardian, a court has heard.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Storey was high on cocaine when he punched mother-of-two Ms McAuley after a row about an ex-girlfriend. The jury at Norwich Crown Court took less than an hour to find Storey guilty. He will be sentenced on Friday. The court had heard friends describe a history of domestic violence which left Ms McAuley \"disfigured\" and fearing for her life. In her texts Ms McAuley described Mr Storey's behaviour as \"not normal\". She wrote: \"you are not ready to care for anyone but yourself\". \"You were trying to kill me, you were suffocating me until I nearly passed out\", adding that if he stays away \"hopefully you won't go to prison for beating me to a pulp\". Later Mr Storey and Ms McAuley agreed to meet up again. Pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift said in the fatal attack Ms McAuley sustained multiple facial lacerations and one of her ears was torn. Dr Swift said some of the injuries were caused by \"blunt force impact\". Storey, of Murrells Court, Norwich, had admitted the pair had a turbulent relationship. He said he was staying at Ms McAuley's home when she confronted him about his ex-girlfriend who she thought was back in contact with him. Storey said he struck her five or six times and had a phone in his hand at the time but insisted he had \"not to hit her with it\".

{"article": "###\nArticle: Sir Bernard announced the move to reassure the public and deter attackers following terrorist attacks in Europe. The Met has already said the number of armed officers will go up in London by 600 to 2,800. And a further 900 armed officers are planned to be in operation for the rest of England and Wales. But Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said it may take two years to fully train the 1,500 recruits planned nationally. \"When you're recruiting 1,500 it's going to take a lot of time. You've got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC. However, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017. The latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month. Londoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city's streets. Teacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds. We shouldn't be complacent\". Retired friends John Lee and John Coles, both from London, agree. \"It's a good thing. It's not going to stop a terror attack, but it makes people feel more secure,\" Mr Coles says. \"I never thought I would see the day British police carried weapons in the street like this, but I think that needs to happen now - whether we like it or not,\" Mr Lee adds. Bricklayer Gary Johns, 34, approved, but says: \"The real question is what their response time is.\" Others, however, say the sight of police carrying heavy weapons makes them uneasy. \"It makes me more nervous than secure to be honest,\" says Bryony Wood, a make-up artist, 26, from west London. \"It's a reminder of what might happen.\" \"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Ebuka Orunta, 20, from south London. \"On one hand I feel safer knowing the Met has a strategy in place to mitigate the risk. \"On the other hand, we've seen the problems with police brutality in the US. It's important the people in charge of this weaponry are the right people who are going to protect us.\" Sir Bernard said: \"We have no intelligence that there will be an attack shortly but what we do know is what we have seen in western Europe. \"We have seen attacks in Germany, in Belgium, in France and we would be foolish to ignore that, so it's important that we get officers out there with firearms to respond.\" The commissioner said the increased firearms teams would be patrolling randomly around the clock. It comes after he told a newspaper that a terror attack on the UK is highly likely and a case of \"when, not if\". Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain. Mr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe... \"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\" By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack. But if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat. Armed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else. Clearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene. None of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging. The Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues\", and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year. In Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris. Meanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place. \"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\" Firearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "More armed police are to be seen on patrol in London, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The measure guarantees a majority of seats to the party that wins the most votes in an election. It is a key element of a package of reforms promised by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. The law seeks to end Italy's post-war era of revolving governments, political horse-trading and unstable coalitions. The lower house of parliament gave final approval to the bill by 334 votes to 61. The proportional election system awards 340 out of 630 seats to any party that wins more than 40% of the national vote. If no party reaches that threshold, there is a second-round run-off between the two parties with the most votes. The electoral reform is expected to come into force next year. After the vote, Mr Renzi said: \"Commitment achieved, promise respected. Italy needs people who don't always say no.\" Critics have accused the 40-year-old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power. They complain that the law awards too much power to single parties, gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates, and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives. Opposition parties boycotted Monday's vote. Renato Brunetta, parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party Forza Italia, said afterwards that it was \"a very ugly day for our country's democracy\". Mr Renzi wants to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-elected body with lesser powers. Currently, legislation is often held up because identical versions of bills have to be approved by both houses.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The Italian parliament has approved a long-debated and extensive electoral reform that aims to give the country more political stability.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Joseph Smith was not in a booster seat and suffered multiple injuries when the car he was in smashed into oncoming traffic on Cardiff's Western Avenue. Dean Collins was found guilty of causing death and causing serious injury by dangerous driving on Tuesday. The 24-year-old, from St Mellons, was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court. He was also handed a three-year sentence for the serious injury charges, which will run concurrently, and has been banned from driving for eight years. The Recorder of Cardiff, Eleri Rees QC, told Collins: \"You have never acknowledged any fault despite overwhelming evidence it was entirely your fault. \"The obvious inference is that you allowed yourself to become distracted. \"The general manner of your driving was impatient and a general disregard for road safety.\" She said he also showed a \"blatant disregard\" for the safety of his four passengers, had shown arrogance and an aggressive manner of driving immediately before the crash. The judge criticised his \"cavalier attitude\" to both his own safety and that if others, adding the lack of a car booster seat had contributed to Joseph's injuries. The trial heard Collins - who had denied all the charges - was driving a borrowed Ford Focus carrying his partner Laura Bright, 23, her mother Michelle Holmes, Joseph, and the couple's two-year-old daughter at the time of the crash. The car crossed a central reservation on Western Avenue and slammed into a white Seat Ibiza heading in the opposite direction. Collins' driving before the collision had been erratic, with the car weaving in and out of traffic and undertaking other vehicles. Blood samples taken from Collins after the collision contained traces of cocaine. But the quantity was too small to accurately measure and a toxicologist said it was not possible to say how the drug would have affected Collins' actions. Collins, who had passed his driving test just three months before, said he had no memory of the crash and insisted it was a \"tragic accident\". Four others suffered injuries in the crash, including fractures to the spine, arms, legs, ribs, memory loss and blindness in one eye. Joseph's mother Laura Bright, who has since married Collins, was unconscious for five days after the crash. She was cleared at a previous hearing of causing the death of a child in her care. The court heard she was now pregnant with his third child. South Wales Police investigating officer PC Tony Farr, of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said the crash had had a \"devastating impact on so many lives\". \"I cannot stress enough how dangerous vehicles can be when they are in the hands of the wrong people,\" he said. \"Collins was inexperienced and evidence presented to the court showed he had taken drugs in the days or hours before the collision. Tragically, that proved to be a lethal combination. \"Collins also failed to ensure Joseph was seated securely in the vehicle - again a huge error in judgement that he will now have to live with for the rest of his life.\" Speaking after the hearing, Joseph's father, Tom Smith, said of the crash: \"It's traumatised me, I don't sleep, all I do is think about that little boy.\" Ann Haile of the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"This case is a stark reminder of how dangerous moving vehicles are when they are not controlled properly, and how important it is for children to be in a suitable, properly fitted car seat.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A driver whose car hit another in a head-on crash, killing his five-year-old stepson, has been jailed for six years.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

His wife was allegedly raped in Badakhshan province eight years ago. But Jahangir says he has been unable to get the alleged rapists arrested because they are politically powerful. His wife told BBC Persian about the incident. \"I told one of them, for God's sake, I have just given birth, I'm like your child, even your daughter is older than me,\" she said. \"I cried a lot, they beat me all over my head and body,\" she said. \"Their bite marks were still on my body until a couple of years ago.\" Analysis: Inayatulhaq Yasini, BBC Pashto The stand taken by Jahangir and his wife breaks something of a taboo in Afghanistan, where victims of sexual crime are generally cowed into silence. Soon after the media picked up the case, President Ghani spoke with Jahangir and promised him that \"the case will be investigated properly and perpetrators will face justice\". The victim herself told the BBC: \"I want justice to save other women from such a fate.\" In the wake of the publicity, the Afghan government will be under pressure to investigate the incident properly and ensure some kind of resolution. But there are also hopes that the stand taken by Jahangir and his wife will embolden other victims of sexual crime, and have a lasting affect on how such cases are dealt with. Jahangir, a policeman, told the BBC eight men were arrested after the incident, but six have now been freed because of their political connections. He says he and his family had to flee to the capital, Kabul, fearing for their lives. He has threatened to kill himself unless that changes: \"If they are not put on trial, I'll have to commit suicide to escape the tensions I'm suffering from. There's no other way.\" Jahangir went public with the threat on Afghan television. He later met the country's interior ministry to press his case. While speaking to the BBC following the meeting, he received a phone call from Mr Ghani. He wept as they spoke. Mr Ghani was sworn in as Afghan president in September, pledging to tackle the issue of corruption as a priority.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The shadow attorney general apologised for the message, which showed a terraced house with three England flags, and a white van parked outside. UKIP said she had \"sneered, and looked down her nose at a white van in Strood with the cross of St George on it\". Labour leader Ed Miliband was \"angry\" at her, a senior figure told the BBC. The resident of the house, Dan Ware, said Ms Thornberry - the MP for Islington South and Finsbury - was a \"snob\". \"I've not got a clue who she is - but she's a snob,\" he told the Sun. \"We put the flags up for the World Cup (in 2014) and will continue to fly them.\" Mr Ware, a car dealer, said he would never vote for Labour in the future, adding that it did not \"matter\" who was in government. \"I think they (Labour) need to get out of their mansions and visit the working class. Her and Ed (Miliband) should come and say sorry to me.\" Ms Thornberry posted the image on Thursday, while voting was taking place in the by-election in Kent. Alongside the picture, she wrote: \"Image from Rochester.\" Labour came third in the high-profile poll behind UKIP, which won the seat and saw its second MP elected to Westminster. Speaking outside her London home, Ms Thornberry said she had \"made a mistake\" and apologised \"if she had upset or insulted anybody\". Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander said Labour leader Ed Miliband had \"not held back\" in expressing his dismay with the MP's actions. \"Anyone who wants to stand for election and be successful next May has to start with a fundamental and deep respect for voters,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. \"The anger Ed (Miliband) felt when he saw that tweet reflected his understanding that we need to earn the support of people around the country.\" BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the tweet had \"given the Tory press an alternative narrative\" to the party's defeat in Rochester. He said: \"It is the most extraordinary self-inflicted wound I have seen an opposition party inflict on themselves in many, many years.\" Prime Minister David Cameron said the Labour MP's actions were \"completely appalling\", suggesting that she was \"sneering at people who work hard, are patriotic and love their country\". The 54-year-old entered Parliament as MP for Islington South and Finsbury in 2005 and served as shadow energy and health spokeswoman before taking the role of shadow attorney general in 2011. The daughter of a former assistant secretary general of the United Nations, she was born in Surrey and was called to the bar in 1983, specialising in criminal law. She had a majority of 3,569 over the Liberal Democrat candidate at the 2010 general election. Rochester and Strood: What's next for parties? How unusual is Rochester and Strood? Ms Thornberry is believed to have had two conversations with Labour leader Ed Miliband after posting the tweet, and offered her resignation during the second one. In a statement released by the Labour Party, Ms Thornberry said: \"Earlier today I sent a tweet which has caused offence to some people. \"That was never my intention and I have apologised. However I will not let anything distract from Labour's chance to win the coming general election.\" \"I have therefore tonight told Ed Miliband I will resign from the shadow cabinet.\" Labour MPs said she had been right to stand down, Chris Bryant telling the BBC \"the first rule of politics is surely that you respect the voters\". \"She was absolutely wrong to tweet what she did,\" he said. \"All I can say is, if somebody came into my constituency and did that, I would be furious.\" And John Mann said the incident was \"horrendous\" for Labour. \"It insults people like me, it insults the people I know - my friends and family - Labour voters across the country because white vans, England flags, they're Labour values and actually pretty routine Labour values for most of us,\" he told Today. He praised Mr Miliband's response, adding: \"I think this is a different approach from the Labour leader and his message came out very, very clearly last night and she's had to go, she's been forced out.\" But Mr Farage suggested the episode reflected broader attitudes within parts of the Labour Party. \"The Labour Party hate the concept of Englishness,\" he told the BBC News Channel. \"They have done for a very long time. \"New Labour can't even stand the concept of patriotism.

{"article": "###\nArticle: He claims Universal Music have only paid the band a \"miniscule fraction\" of the money they were owed from downloads on sites like iTunes and Amazon. The musician is suing for compensation, according to legal documents filed in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The claim is also filed on behalf of his sister, Karen, who died in 1983. Carpenter hired accountants to examine financial statements from Universal Music and its subsidiary, A&M Records, which has released The Carpenters' music since their debut album in 1969. He says they found multiple errors, and that the labels \"improperly classified\" revenue from digital downloads of The Carpenters' music as sales of physical records  - which attract a lower royalty rate. He also claims that digital downloads were undercounted. In a statement, Carpenter said he had been unable to resolve the dispute without suing. \"The Carpenters recordings are among the best sellers in the history of popular music, and after 48 years continue to contribute a substantial amount to [Universal's] annual bottom line,\" he wrote. \"It seems only fair that these companies account fairly to my sister's estate and to me.\" Specialising in radio-friendly soft rock, The Carpenters sold millions of records in the 1970s. The brother-sister duo won three Grammy Awards in 1970 and 1971, including best new artist and best vocal performance for the ballad (They Long to Be) Close to You. The band's career was cut short when Karen developed anorexia nervosa in 1975. Although they continued to record, the condition eventually led to her death, from heart failure. Richard Carpenter's legal claim is one of many filed in the US after a 2010 court case involving Eminem, which resulted in a ruling that artists should receive higher royalty payments for digital downloads than they do when a CD or vinyl album is sold. The difference is substantial. According to Billboard, artists get 15% of the money generated by the sale of a record. For downloads, which are counted as \"licensed content\",  the figure 50%. Artists including Peter Frampton, Public Enemy, Whitesnake and The Temptations have all sued, or threatened to sue, in order to obtain the higher rate.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The visit comes after Myanmar opened up to international trade and investment following decades of military rule. The delegation includes temporary power company Aggreko and oil and gas firms Wood Group, Asco and Bibby Offshore. Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary David Mundell is in Texas to try to boost support for the North Sea oil sector. The UK government minister said he was flying to the US to build links with the country's oil industry. The Myanmar delegation is being led by Scottish Enterprise chief executive Lena Wilson. Ms Wilson also chairs Scotland's Energy Jobs Taskforce, set up last year by the Scottish government to help tackle the challenges facing the sector following the sustained fall in oil prices. The delegation will meet Myanmar's new minister for energy and electricity, Pe Zin Tun, as well as local and international oil and gas companies already active in the country to \"explore key opportunities in the local supply chain\". Scottish Enterprise said Myanmar had vast underdeveloped oil and gas reserves in deep waters similar to that of the North Sea. According to the economic development agency, the Myanmar government is also keen to develop its own oil and gas industry and wants to capitalise on foreign investment and technology to build local capacity and expertise. Ms Wilson said: \"Scotland and Myanmar have strong historic connections going right back to the 19th century when Scottish owned Burmah Oil Company became the first company to drill for oil in the country in 1886. \"Myanmar now stands at exciting phase of its own oil and gas development - much like Aberdeen did in the 1970s - with huge natural resources to capitalise on. \"But to grow its local industry, it will need access to technology, skills and expertise across the whole supply chain from seismic surveying and engineering design right through to project management, health and safety and training and education. \"These are all core strengths of Scotland's oil and gas industry built up through 50 years of experience of working in the North Sea. \"We have a real opportunity now to show how Scotland can help support Myanmar to build the capacity it needs while at the same time providing much needed international opportunities for our own industry.\" The trade mission follows a visit by a Myanmar delegation to Offshore Europe in Aberdeen last year, which visited a number of Scottish companies including Wood Group in Aberdeen and ASCO's supply base in Peterhead. Following the visit to Myanmar, Ms Wilson will then travel to Vietnam along with some of the Scottish companies to identify potential opportunities in what is seen as a more established oil and gas market which is still relatively untapped by Scottish companies. During his trip to the US, Mr Mundell will meet senior figures in the oil centres of Houston and Dallas to encourage ongoing investment into the North Sea. The talks will involve firms such as Maersk, BP and the Weir Group, he will also seek to find new ways in which Scottish companies could export their expertise in the industry. Mr Mundell said: \"The UK government is determined to do everything it can to support the industry and the many jobs which depend on it. \"My visit to the United States is part of that strategy.\" \"The north east of Scotland also has a huge amount of expertise which can be exported around the world and the US should be a part of its market.\" He added: \"There are wider lessons for the north east of Scotland to learn from the American oil and gas industry, and from cities like Dallas and Houston. \"They have successfully diversified their economies, and I will be hearing from officials in those cities about the lessons they have learned and we could apply them in Scotland.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A delegation of Scottish companies is heading to Myanmar this week in an effort to tap into opportunities in the country's oil and gas sector.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: For decades, large numbers of Haitians have migrated - many of them without papers - to the Dominican Republic, to escape the poverty and lack of employment in their homeland. In 2013, the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled that children born there to undocumented migrants were not automatically eligible for Dominican nationality. An 18-month period followed in which undocumented migrants were asked to \"regulate their status\". Thousands who did not meet the deadline left the Dominican Republic, with many saying they were forced out by the authorities. As the BBC's Will Grant found, the Catholic Church has played a key role in the migration crisis with some priests defending the rights of the returnees while others have been criticised for promoting what activists describe as a policy of division. Weekly Mass at Parc Cadeau is a simple affair. The church is a small hut made of wicker and palm, the congregation spread out over a few wooden benches. Looking around the camp, one of several along Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic, you might think that the parishioners have little to be thankful for. It is surely one of the poorest places in Latin America. A year ago thousands of returning Haitians arrived at Parc Cadeau. Some had been forcibly deported from the Dominican Republic, others left voluntarily to avoid confrontation with the authorities. Today hundreds of families remain on the dusty ranch, living in hastily erected shacks of plastic sheeting, cardboard and rope, trapped in near stateless limbo. Soinicier Giles is typical of many in the camp. He spent 22 years living as a farmer in the Dominican Republic, before being deported last year. He takes me to a ramshackle hut to meet his wife Eleny and six of their eight children. The other two were left behind when he was deported. The conditions are extremely harsh, especially for the youngest. \"We sleep directly on the floor and it gets wet inside when it rains,\" Eleny explains. The children were all born in the Dominican Republic itself. They are showing signs of malnutrition and have developed a skin condition since arriving at the camp. \"They're very hungry, we all are, because we can only afford one meal a day,\" she says in Creole-accented Spanish. One of the few local figures helping the returnees is the parish priest, Father Luc Leandre. With funds from the International Organisation for Migration, he has helped relocate some of the most desperate families to nearby communities in Haiti. \"It's a grave crisis, very, very bad,\" Father Leandre tells me. \"The Church is like a mother for everyone and I have a duty to help. Not only that, the Pope told everyone they have to help the refugees wherever they are.\" But Father Leandre says the attitude of some conservative priests on the other side of the border, particularly in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, has complicated his work. \"The cardinal in Santo Domingo is personally very vocal in his support for the deportations. He supported sending all the Haitians back to their country.\" \"It's racism,\" he laments, saying the law specifically targeted black Haitians, a charge denied by lawmakers in the Dominican Republic. The priest Father Leandre was referring to has been the most influential voice in the Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic for almost 40 years: the controversial and outspoken Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez. Earlier this month, Pope Francis accepted the cardinal's resignation, which all archbishops are obliged to offer once they reach the age of 75. But he will remain an important figure in the Church and in Dominican public life. The BBC repeatedly requested an interview with Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus so he could respond to the criticisms against him but both he and his press secretary declined. In many ways, the Haitian migrant crisis has exposed greater divisions within the Catholic Church in Hispaniola over where it should position itself in the 21st Century. Pope Francis - both the first Jesuit pope and the first from Latin America - designated 2016 as the \"Year of Mercy\" and certainly Jesuits have been instrumental in supporting the Haitian returnees. In a video that went viral, the cardinal was filmed in a furious diatribe about a Jesuit priest called Mario Serrano calling him \"shameless\" and a \"leftist\". \"He's not very accustomed to being publically confronted,\" Mario Serrano tells me from the northern border region of Dajabon, where he works with undocumented Haitians. \"I just said that (his) kind of speech was not according to the Catholic teaching and was not for a priest or a Christian. \"I think that really made him mad.\" Supporters of the new regularisation law, such as the former Dominican ambassador to the US, Flavio Espinal, deny that the legislation was either cruel or motivated by racism. \"Nothing's perfect and the process here has not been perfect. Yet this has been an extraordinary step forward in the direction of regularising close to 300,000 people who were undocumented in this country. \"That's not an easy decision to make nowadays.\" At night, to avoid detection, the farmer Soinicier Giles leaves Parc Cadeau and slips back into the Dominican Republic, the border marked by the Pedernales River. There he strips the trees for firewood to make charcoal, to sell to Dominican traders for a few dollars. He knows the practice damages the fertility of the soil, but it's the only available source of income. \"This is the only way we can survive,\" he says, motioning at his family, stuck inside the world's forgotten migrant crisis.

But members of his own party, including several state premiers, have called for more to be done for refugees. Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Monday called for temporary housing of Syrian and Iraqi asylum seekers. Mr Frydenberg said there was a good case for a Kosovo-type solution that would see Syrian and Iraqi refugees housed in Australia, then returned home once the countries were safe. The Federal Opposition on Monday called for 10,000 additional places for refugees from the Middle East, with priority to be given to those from conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten also said the government should spend an extra $A100m ($69m; \u00c2\u00a345.6m) on aid for refugees. The Liberal Premier of Australia's most populous state, New South Wales, Mike Baird, on Saturday challenged Mr Abbott to do more than just stopping refugees making their way to Australia by boat. Reacting to a photo of a Syrian child refugee recently found drowned on a Turkish beach, Mr Baird said he felt \"sick with overwhelming sorrow\" about the situation. Mr Baird, a close colleague of Mr Abbott's, said it was a great thing that Australia was no longer seeing children drowning at sea after trying to get to Australia by boat with their families. \"But stopping the boats can't be where this ends ... I believe we should do even more. And we should do it now,\" he said, adding that he would talk to the Federal government about what could be done. Australia detains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat, and takes them to offshore processing centres to be resettled elsewhere. Last week, the New York Times described the policy as \"brutal\". The lightly-populated island state of Tasmania has also said it would accept an extra 500 refugees, with Liberal Premier Will Hodgman declaring \"our door's open\". Australia has accepted about 4,500 people fleeing Syria's conflict, under its current commitment of 13,750 refugees for 2015. Mr Abbott has claimed Australia is \"already the most generous country in the world on a per capita basis when it comes to dealing with refugees through the UNHCR\". Several organisations have challenged that claim. During a press conference on Sunday, the Prime Minister spoke of how horrified he was by the image of the drowned Syrian boy. \"No parent could fail to be moved by what we saw,\" he said. \"I have asked the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to go urgently to Geneva to talk to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on what more Australia can do to assist on the migration crisis that is being driven by the problems in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott is under pressure to increase the country's total refugee intake.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead announced the move earlier this month. Almost 30 organisations have signed an open letter seeking an urgent meeting with him to discuss their concerns. Mr Lochhead said the changes would not affect research. Under EU rules, GM crops must be formally authorised before they can be cultivated. An amendment came into force earlier this year, allowing member states and devolved administrations to restrict or ban the cultivation of genetically modified organisms within their territory. Mr Lochhead announced he would use the amendment to request Scotland be excluded from European consents for the cultivation of GM crops. The letter - whose signatories include the National Farmers' Union, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Roslin Institute and the European Academies Science Advisory Council - said they were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"negative impact\" a ban could have. It claimed the decision was \"political and not based on any informed scientific assessment of risk\". The scientists and academics said outlawing the cultivation of GM crops \"risks constraining Scotland's contribution to research and leaving Scotland without access to agricultural innovations which are making farming more sustainable elsewhere in the world.\" The letter cited examples where \"a GM method has a contribution to make\". It highlighted ongoing research on things which \"might benefit Scotland's farmers, consumers and environment\" including potatoes that can reduce fungicide use and omega-3 enriched oilseeds that may offer a more sustainable source of feed for salmon farming. Responding to the letter, Mr Lochhead said he respected the views of those in the scientific community and would be happy to meet them. He said he would \"reassure them that these changes will not affect research as it is currently carried out in Scotland, where the contained use of GM plants is permitted for scientific purposes, such as in laboratories or sealed glasshouse facilities\". He added: \"However, just because GM crops can be cultivated in Scotland it doesn't mean they should be. \"Scotland's \u00c2\u00a314bn food sector has a reputation for a clean and green image across the world and allowing the cultivation of GM crops could damage that unique selling point.\" Last week, a former chief science adviser to the Scottish government warned on ban on GM crops could have \"apocalyptic\" consequences and threaten the country's food and drinks industry. Prof Muffy Calder, who stepped down from the role in December and has yet to be replaced, said she was \"disappointed and angry\" and called on ministers to publish the scientific basis for their decision. Professor Neva Haites, vice president for life sciences at The Royal Society of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland: \"Most governments try to get the best advice possible before they make these decisions. \"In the past we have had chief scientific advisers such as Dame Anne Glover and Prof Calder, who were there to give advice on such subjects. \"We no longer have such an adviser in government at the moment and the scientific body that usually gives advice has not met for some time. \"So we are suggesting it is time they actually looked again and sought some very senior advice on this subject.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A ban on growing genetically-modified crops in Scotland could threaten the country's contribution to scientific research, according to scientists, universities and farming leaders.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Daley had admitted stabbing Mr Lock to death, claiming diminished responsibility. Lewes Crown Court heard Daley suffered from chronic mental health problems. The judge, Mr Justice Singh, adjourned the case for sentencing on 8 July. Mr Lock's family said the manslaughter verdict brought to a close the \"most horrific 10 months of our lives and brings some sort of justice for Dad\". However, they blamed the NHS for his death. \"This verdict effectively provides the Daley family with what they have wanted for the last few years, their son in a safe place away from harm and being treated correctly,\" the family said in a statement. \"For them they can still visit their son, hug him and talk to him and enjoy aspects of his life with him albeit constrained at the same time. \"For us all we can do is cling on to the wonderful memories of Dad. \"As a consequence of the failings of the NHS and this verdict, it is clear that Dad would still be here today if they had done their job properly.\" During the trial, jurors were told Daley's mother pleaded with mental health experts to have her son sectioned. She told the court, that the day she heard Mr Lock was killed was \"the day that all your nightmares came true\". Daley was charged with murder, but never denied killing Mr Lock. During police interview, he told detectives how he had used a knife to fatally stab Mr Lock, and while in prison awaiting trial he wrote and addressed a letter to the BBC in London, about what had happened on 16 July.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The initial estimate showed growth picking up from the first quarter of the year, when it was 0.2%. The ONS said the growth was driven by services, particularly retail, which more than offset falls in output in the manufacturing and construction sectors. It added there had been a \"notable slowdown\" in growth from last year. However, the figure for the second quarter was in line with economists' expectations. Analysts said the rise in growth was unlikely to change expectations that the Bank of England will keep interest rates at their current record low next week. ONS head of national accounts Darren Morgan said: \"The economy has experienced a notable slowdown in the first half of this year.\" Film production in the UK, plus box-office receipts from cinemas, was one of the best performing parts of the economy during the period. \"While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth,\" Mr Morgan said. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for UK economic growth this year because of the weak first-quarter figure. The IMF said it expects UK GDP to grow by 1.7% instead of its previous projection of 2%. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK economy had now grown consistently for four-and-a-half years. \"We can be proud of that, but we are not complacent,\" he added. \"We need to focus on restoring productivity growth to deliver higher wages and living standards for people across the country.\" Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \"Today's GDP figures reveal weak growth under a weak government, and expose the last seven years of Tory economic failure. \"Growth for the first half of 2017 is below expectations, and it follows continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices.\" Aberdeen Asset Management chief economist Lucy O'Carroll said: \"This pick-up will be taken as good news, but it really doesn't amount to much. \"The figures are the first estimate of growth, based on very patchy data.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Another measure of success in Canada will be the crowd for the first Women's FA Cup final to be held at Wembley on Saturday. We've already seen record crowds at Women's Super League games since we've arrived home and about 30,000 tickets have been sold for the game between my team Chelsea and Notts County, which will set a new benchmark. Media playback is not supported on this device If we see those numbers, I see no reason why the FA Cup final cannot be played at Wembley every year. Women's football in England is now worthy of that stage and as one of the first two teams to play this historic occasion, we will be proud to be part of another pioneering moment. In the build-up to the game, some of my team-mates have been asking me about playing at Wembley, having played there for England against Germany last November and while representing Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics. I can only say that it is a unique, out-of-body experience to play in front of so many people. It's a feeling that never gets old and we will be going to Wembley before Saturday so that those new to it can get a feel of the iconic 90,000-seat stadium. In attempting to win Chelsea's first piece of silverware, it's the biggest game in the club's history, but one thing I've been telling them is we have to play the game and not the occasion. I wouldn't care if it was being played in a local park in Wembley, the most important thing is to win. With Chelsea's men's team also playing at Wembley the following day when the Premier League champions take on FA Cup winners Arsenal in the Community Shield, we want to make it a historic weekend. There are many players in our team who have won the FA Cup before, including myself. The first time was in 2005 with Charlton when I scored the winner against Everton and in 2012 I was part of the Birmingham team which beat Chelsea on penalties following a 2-2 draw. In our dressing room we have midfielder Katie Chapman, who has won the FA Cup eight times, and Gilly Flaherty, who has won it five times, so we are not lacking pedigree. Media playback is not supported on this device But having missed out on WSL so narrowly last season [on goal difference to Liverpool], it's fair to say that this could mean more because of the journey we have been on together. Despite losing our last two league games, we aren't panicking. We have strong characters in the dressing room and the belief that got us to the FA Cup final and saw us go unbeaten in 13 matches this year. There has been plenty of talk about the fact that our unbeaten start to the league season has come to an end. It would have been nice to hold onto that record, but the WSL is a very competitive league and every team in it has dropped points. We were the last to do so. We didn't play well in a 4-0 loss at Sunderland but the promoted side are now top of the league and our defeat by Manchester City last Sunday came courtesy of a very fortunate winner. Despite the result, our performance was pleasing. We are a point off the top with five games left and to be in that position in such a competitive season is positive. Our focus is now on Saturday and we are confident we can win. Another positive from the World Cup has been the boost to crowds in the WSL. The first weekend after we arrived back saw record numbers for Manchester City, while 2,061 watched Liverpool beat Arsenal, and more than 1,200 saw us beat Bristol. Media playback is not supported on this device Three weeks after our return, the bounce has lasted. Our first home defeat in more than 18 months by Manchester City was watched by a club-record 1,857 at Staines FC. Those numbers are a credit to marketing staff at WSL clubs and the players, who are obviously putting on a good show in order to entice supporters back. The time we spend with fans immediately after games also helps too, I think. The test now comes when the Premier League starts on 8 August. With the Continental Cup now under way again, our season doesn't end until October, so hopefully the upsurge in attendances will continue and women's football will still very much be something people want to watch.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The project will examine hair, bone and other material from a collection amassed by a Swiss biologist - and will invite submissions from elsewhere. Many cultures relate legends of hairy, humanoid creatures that lurk in the wilds, rarely seen. But material claimed to be from such creatures have never been subjected to modern scientific techniques. \"It's an area that any serious academic ventures into with a deal of trepidation... It's full of eccentric and downright misleading reports,\" said Prof Bryan Sykes, from Oxford University. The researchers will apply a systematic approach and employ the latest advances in genetic testing, aiming to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals. \"There have been DNA tests done on alleged yetis and other such things but since then the testing techniques, particularly on hair, have improved a lot due to advances in forensic science,\" the Oxford geneticist told Reuters news agency. Modern testing could get valid results from a fragment of a shaft of hair, added Prof Sykes, who is leading the project with Michel Sartori, director of the Lausanne Museum of Zoology. A 1951 expedition to Mount Everest famously returned with photographs of giant footprints in the snow, fuelling speculation about giant Himalayan creatures, unknown to science. Since then, many eye-witness reports of such creatures have emerged from remote regions of the world. These humanoid beasties are variously known as the \"yeti\" or \"migoi\" in the Himalayas, \"bigfoot\" or \"sasquatch\" in North America, \"almasty\" in the Caucasus mountains and \"orang pendek\" in Sumatra, but there are many others. Tests up to now have usually concluded that alleged yeti remains were in fact human. But, said Prof Sykes, \"there has been no systematic review of this material.\" The project will focus on an archive of remains held at the Lausanne museum that was assembled by Bernard Heuvelmans, a Belgian-French biologist who investigated reported yeti sightings from 1950 up to his death in 2001. Other institutions and individuals will also be asked to send in details of any possible yeti material. Aside from the yeti question, Prof Sykes said he hoped the project would add to the growing body of knowledge on the interaction between different human species in the past. \"In the last two years it has become clear that there was considerable interbreeding between             Homo sapiens and Neanderthals ... about 2% to 4% of the DNA of each individual European is Neanderthal,\" he said. Those who are favourable to the idea of as-yet undescribed creatures say the yeti and orang pendek could represent survivals of             Homo erectus,             Homo floresiensis (the Indonesian \"Hobbit\") or             Gigantopithecus - a giant ape that once inhabited the forests of East Asia. The idea has even spawned the term \"cryptozoology\" to describe the search for such beasts. Others are highly sceptical of such tales, and consider the subject unworthy of serious scientific investigation. Asked about the project's chances of success, Prof Sykes said: \"The answer is, of course, I don't know,\" adding, \"it's unlikely, but on the other hand if we don't examine it we won't know.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A UK-Swiss team will use DNA testing to investigate the origins of remains claimed to be from yeti and bigfoot.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Council for Science and Technology (CST) wants \"public good\" GM varieties to be grown and tested in the UK. It says GM crops should be assessed individually - like pharmaceuticals - taking potential benefits into account. A new UK regulator similar to NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) should be set up, it says. The UK is a world leader in plant biotechnology research, but GM field trial applications have fallen from 37 in 1995 to just one in 2012. By David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The controversy over genetically modifying plants is riddled with contradictions. Take the European Union. Its internal politics have caused a logjam in approvals but the EU science budget is also funding some of Britain's research. Europe grows very few GM plants but most of its imported animal feed is genetically modified. It was America's agricultural giants whose hard sell of GM put off so many European consumers but it is also US science that provides the evidence, gathered over the past two decades, that supports the assurance that GM plants and food are safe. And while Britain's leading plant scientists appeal to the prime minister to help foster this new technology, its leading supermarket chains avoid stocking GM products because no-one is asking for them. So can anything shift? The key is whether ministers can change minds in Brussels - and that's no easy task given the hostility towards GM in big players like France and Germany. A long haul lies ahead. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has spoken in favour of increasing UK research into GM, which he said offers the \"most wonderful opportunities to improve human health.\" The CST was asked by Prime Minister David Cameron for the latest evidence on the risks and benefits of GM technologies in agriculture, and for advice on UK and EU regulation. In turn, it commissioned a group of leading plant scientists from Rothamsted Research, The Sainsbury Laboratory and Cambridge University to make recommendations to the prime minister. The scientists say they are being held back by strict EU regulations - based on the principle that GM crops are inherently more dangerous than conventionally-bred varieties. Only two GM varieties have been licensed for commercial harvest in Europe - despite the fact that 12% of the world's arable land is cultivating GM crops. The CST report argues GM crops have now been shown to be safe - and may be necessary in future for Britain to grow its own food supply, rather than depending on imports. It says the UK should regulate commercial GM varieties of wheat and potatoes based on their individual benefits and risks - rather than follow the EU's blanket approach. It also recommends a new programme of publicly-funded field trials to test \"public good\" GM crop varieties, which it calls \"PubGM\". \"Public good\" traits could include nutritional enhancement, such as antioxidants in tomatoes, or vitamin A in \"Golden Rice\". They could also include \"climate-proofing\" properties such as drought resistance or heat resistance. \"With PubGM, seed companies, consumers and regulators will be able to decide, based on results of experiments, whether a GM trait has proved its worth in UK crops under UK conditions,\" said Professor Jonathan Jones from The Sainsbury Laboratory, one of the report's authors. Sir Mark Walport, chief scientific adviser and CST co-chair, said: \"We take it for granted that because our shelves in supermarkets are heaving with food there are no problems in food security. But there are. \"We're part of a global food market. Competition is likely to increase. The world is already malnourished and the population is growing. \"The challenge is to get more yield from the same area. GM is not a magic bullet, but it is one of a range of technologies that we should consider.\" The report was welcomed by Dr Julian Little, chair of the Agricultural Biotechnology Council (ABC), which represents companies including BASF, Monsanto and Syngenta. \"Current EU regulation has moved in the direction of increasing political influence and undermining science. \"Europe risks being left behind and it therefore remains essential that action is taken to address the dysfunctional EU approvals process so that UK farmers may, in the future, be able to realise the potential of great British biotechnology research right here in the UK.\" But the environmental group Friends of the Earth say GM will not make food more affordable or sustainable. \"GM crops have been hugely over-hyped.

She told BBC News: \"It takes 10 years to get European regulators to approve a new GM trial, and costs in the order of $150m. How can any small company do that?\" \"NGOs complain that GM only benefits multinational companies - but that's because they're the only ones who can afford it.

Mr Netanyahu said the comments were outrageous, cheapened the Holocaust and caused harm to Israel. Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon said he had \"total confidence\" in Gen Golan. \"If there's something that frightens me about Holocaust remembrance it's the recognition of the nauseating processes that occurred in Europe in general, and particularly in Germany, back then - 70, 80 and 90 years ago - and finding signs of them here among us today in 2016,\" the deputy chief of staff said on Wednesday. \"There is, after all, nothing easier and simpler than hating the  foreigner... arousing fears and terrifying.\" But Mr Netanyahu said Gen Golan's remarks were \"utterly mistaken and unacceptable to me\". \"The comparison drawn in the words of the deputy chief of staff regarding  events which characterised Nazi Germany 80 years ago is outrageous,\" he said. \"They do injustice to Israeli society and cause a belittling of the Holocaust.\" Correspondents say right-wing members of Mr Netanyahu's coalition have called for Gen Golan's resignation, accusing him of dishonouring the dead. But Defence Minister Yaalon said the criticism was an attempt to cause political harm to the military. \"The attacks against [Gen Golan] and the current criticism against him are deliberate distortions of interpretation of the things he said last night,\" he added. The remarks come at a time of heightened tension between Israelis and Palestinians. A wave of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs over the past eight months have left 29 Israelis dead. More than 200 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period. There has been debate and controversy over Israelis' response to the attacks. In March, an Israeli soldier was filmed shooting dead a wounded Palestinian. He has been charged with manslaughter. There has been some public sympathy for the soldier but Mr Yaalon backed the military establishment in prosecuting him. In October last year, an Eritrean immigrant was shot and beaten to death by an angry crowd after being mistaken for an Arab militant in the town of Beersheba, prompting concern about mob reactions to people thought to be suspicious.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has issued a stern public rebuke to the military deputy chief of staff.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: ScotRail said the Glasgow Queen Street Station tunnel would be closed from 20 March until 8 August. Services will divert to low-level platforms or Glasgow Central, bringing timetable changes and in some cases, longer journey times. The work is part of a \u00c2\u00a360m upgrade project that will allow faster and longer trains to use the station.

Phil Verster, managing director of the ScotRail Alliance, said: \"Upgrading the tunnel will allow us to run faster, longer, greener trains in the future. \"This will mean more seats, shorter journey times and less impact on our environment. \"The long-term benefits of this investment will be considerable, not just for our railway, but also for the country.\" ScotRail said the closure was necessary to enable major engineering work to renew 1,800m of existing concrete slab track formation, which carries the rails through the 918m tunnel. The firm said this was the largest engineering project undertaken on the Edinburgh to Glasgow, via Falkirk High, railway, since it was built. The project will involve 140 days of continuous round-the-clock working, the removal of 10,000 tonnes of existing concrete slab and the installation of 4,000m of new rails.

{"article": "###\nArticle: But the overall national picture for GCSE grades is very similar to last year. The proportion getting A* to C grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%. That represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A* and A grades - is that there is \"stability\". This isn't an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate. It's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be. Well, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature. The huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils. Add to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results. He has warned of \"volatility\", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective. \"It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said Mr Lightman. The lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades? Ofqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system. But it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems. Once there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same. Another factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam. This year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort. There are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt. And another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds. But if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Northern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales. Not only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%. England's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead. When these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else. The scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%. In England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades. This sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places. Whether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible. Because in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland. Another curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term? It would take another exam to answer that one.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The results have been published for more than five million GCSE entries - which will be five million different stories of exam dreams, dramas and disasters.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: People refusing to believe that the London 2012 Games, seven years in the making and more than a month in the doing, had finally ended. Fans not wanting to take in the fact that there would be no more waking up to read news of British gold medal wins, no more anticipating who had the chance of glory that day and no more watching, either on TV or in person, sports to which usually they would not give even a second thought. And what about the feel-good factor which has been so evident since the start of the Olympics at the end of July? People seem determined to hold on to that for as long as possible - and that was proved in Olympic Park straight after the ceremony had finished. While thousands drifted away to the various stations and thoughts of Monday morning blues, others did not want to let go of the dream. Some Brazilian drumming and impromptu dancing near the Stratford Gate was just one example. But walking further round the stadium, you came across a band giving a mini-concert with around two hundred people joining in. The atmosphere was amazing with the crowd, made up of fans, Games Makers and security staff, dancing and singing along and imploring the musicians, who were playing brass instruments, to keep playing. \"One more song\" they chanted to keep the festivities going - and when they were rewarded they responded with a giant conga. Strangers grabbed hold of people they had never met before as the line weaved its way in and out of the other celebrants in an amazing example of human exuberance. One Games Maker told me that her train was due to leave in half an hour but that she had no intention of getting it and that they would have to drag her out of the Park, such was her desire not to let the moment end. And in the half hour I spent witnessing and taking part in this party the spirit of the Paralympic and Olympic Games in London this summer was summed up. Right from the start people have embraced it, celebrated it and wanted to be a part of it. Olympic or Paralympic - it made no difference to sports-mad Britons who bought tickets for whatever event in whatever Games they could lay their hands on. Seb Coe, chairman of organisers Locog, said before the Paralympics that he wanted people to appreciate the quality of the sport and that is what they did with David Weir feted just as much as Jessica Ennis. And that is why it was fitting that, in the final ceremony of the Games on Sunday night, the athletes were centre stage. They marched in casually and sat on seats around the edge of the grass area in the Stadium which had been used for field events. It meant they could watch the whole show, rather than just the end of it, and appreciate the whole spectacular evening. They were so relaxed that some of them tried to start a Mexican wave before the ceremony got under way. Other people feted on the night were the armed forces and the Games Maker volunteers, who received a massive cheer from the crowd. Coldplay and Rihanna had the crowd rocking and a spectacular light display made for some brilliant viewing. The ideas of flames and of moving through the seasons signalled the continuation of life - a message to the millions of people who were disappointed at the Games' end. So what comes next? In the immediate short-term, the celebrations will continue for one more day with the parade of Olympic and Paralympic athletes through central London on Monday. But what happens after that which is also important - millions of people will take away wonderful memories of attending or watching the Games which will last for years to come. However the sports themselves need participation and interest in order to maintain the momentum built up. A festival of disability sports is planned before the end of the year, during which people can try out the sports for themselves, and maybe take them up. But if interest in disbility sports is to continue, organisers know media coverage is key. During both the Olympics and Paralympics, the Games have regularly featured on both the front and back pages of the newspapers with special supplements published in the middle. However Lord Coe is worried that interest may fade quickly. He expressed disappointment that England's World Cup qualifying win in Moldova knocked the Paralympics off the back pages on Saturday morning. But that is for the future and this is still the time to reflect on what International Paralmpic Committee president Sir Philip Craven described as \"the greatest Paralympic Games ever\". And on the achievements of Britain in staging such successful Games as Lord Coe explained in his speech: \"There are some famous words you can find stamped on the bottom of a product. Words, that when you read them, you know mean high quality, mean skill, mean creativity. \"We have stamped those words on the Olympic and Paralympic games of London 2012. \"London 2012.

{"article": "###\nArticle: As Iraq lurches deeper into turmoil and disintegration, Kurdish leaders in the already autonomous north are threatening to break away and declare outright independence. And the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), bulldozing the border between Iraq and Syria in June 2014, declared their intention to eradicate all the region's frontiers and lay Sykes-Picot to rest forever. Whatever the fate of IS, the future as unitary states of both Syria and Iraq - central to the Sykes-Picot project - is up in the air. In fact, virtually none of the Middle East's present-day frontiers were actually delineated in the document concluded on 16 May 1916 by British and French diplomats Mark Sykes and Francois Georges-Picot. The Iraq-Syria border post histrionically erased by IS was probably several hundred kilometres from the famous \"line in the sand\" drawn by Sykes and Picot, which ran almost directly from the Persian border in the north-east, down between Mosul and Kirkuk and across the desert towards the Mediterranean, veering northwards to loop around the top end of Palestine. The region's current borders emerged from a long and complex process of treaties, conferences, deals and conflicts that followed the break-up of the Ottoman Empire and the end of World War One. But the spirit of Sykes-Picot, dominated by the interests and ruthless ambitions of the two main competing colonial powers, prevailed during that process and through the coming decades, to the Suez crisis of 1956 and even beyond. Because it inaugurated that era, and epitomised the concept of clandestine colonial carve-ups, Sykes-Picot has become the label for the whole era in which outside powers imposed their will, drew borders and installed client local leaderships, playing divide-and-rule with the \"natives\", and beggar-my-neighbour with their colonial rivals. The resulting order inherited by the Middle East of the day sees a variety of states whose borders were generally drawn with little regard for ethnic, tribal, religious or linguistic considerations. Often a patchwork of minorities, there is a natural tendency for such countries to fall apart unless held together by the iron grip of a strongman or a powerful central government. The irony is that the two most potent forces explicitly assailing the Sykes-Picot legacy are at each other's throats: the militants of IS, and the Kurds in the north of both Iraq and Syria. In both countries, the Kurds have proven the Western coalition's most effective allies in combating IS, although the two sides share a determination to redraw the map. \"It's not just me that's saying it, the fact is that Sykes-Picot has failed, it's over,\" said the president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan Region, Massoud Barzani, in a BBC interview. \"There has to be a new formula for the region. I'm very optimistic that within this new formula, the Kurds will achieve their historic demand and right [to independence]\". \"We have passed through bitter experiences since the formation of the Iraqi state after World War One. We tried to preserve the unity of Iraq, but we are not responsible for its fragmentation - it's the others who broke it up. \"We don't want to be part of the chaos and problems which surround Iraq from all sides.\" President Barzani said the drive for independence was very serious, and that preparations were going ahead \"full steam\". He said the first step should be \"serious negotiations\" with the central government in Baghdad to reach an understanding and a solution, towards what Kurdish leaders are optimistically calling an \"amicable separation\". If that did not produce results, he said, the Kurds should go ahead unilaterally with a referendum on independence. \"It's a necessary step, because all the previous attempts and experiments failed. If current conditions aren't helpful for independence, there are no circumstances which favour not demanding this right.\" Iraq's Kurds are landlocked and surrounded by neighbours - Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq itself - which have traditionally quashed Kurdish aspirations. Under threat from IS, they are more dependent than ever on Western powers which are also strongly counselling them to stick with Iraq. But whether or not the Iraqi Kurds achieve full formal independence in the near future, they have already established an entity with borders, a flag, international airports, a parliament and government, and its own security forces - everything except a passport and their own currency. To that extent, they have already redrawn the map. And next door in northern Syria, their fellow Kurds are essentially doing the same, controlling and running large swathes of land along the Turkish border under the title of \"self-administration\". As for IS, its territorial gains have already peaked. But the chaos in both Iraq and Syria that allowed it to take root have yet to run their course - the alienation of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority (and the Kurds), and Syria's fragmentation in a vicious sectarian civil war. The unspoken struggle is over whether formulas can be found for different communities to live together within the borders bequeathed by 20th Century history, or whether new frontiers will have to be drawn to accommodate those peoples - however that concept is defined. \"Sykes-Picot is finished, that's for sure, but everything is now up in the air, and it will be a long time before it becomes clear what the result will be,\" said the veteran Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt. The Sykes-Picot agreement conflicted directly with pledges of freedom given by the British to the Arabs in exchange for their support against the collapsing Ottomans. It also collided with the vision of the US President Woodrow Wilson, who preached self-determination for the peoples subjugated by the Ottoman Empire. His foreign policy adviser Edward House was later informed of the agreement by UK Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, who 18 months on was to put his name to a declaration which was to have an even more fateful impact on the region. House wrote: \"It is all bad and I told Balfour so. They are making it a breeding place for future war.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Reaching its centenary amidst a general chorus of vilification around the region, the legacy of the secret Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 has never looked more under assault.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device The Premier League paid \u00a3174m to agents, up from \u00a3130m, with Manchester City being the biggest spenders (\u00a326.3m) ahead of Chelsea (\u00a325.1m) and Manchester United (\u00a319m). England's second tier, the Championship, spent \u00a342.4m on agents, an increase of 62%. The Football Association figures cover from February 2016 to January 2017. They come two years after the last full-year results (2014-15). Premier League teams spent a record \u00a31.38bn on transfers in the 2016-17 season - a 43% increase on transfer spending from the 2014-15 season. In both League One and League Two the total spending on agents and intermediaries decreased from the 2014-15 figures. League One sides spent \u00a33,098,508, down from \u00a33,167,964, while League Two teams spent \u00a3821,450, down from \u00a31,007,920. Liverpool led the Premier League in agents' fees when the last full-year results were published for the period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, but the Reds' spending has decreased from \u00a314.3m to \u00a313.8 for the 2016-17 period. Manchester City now top the Premier League list with \u00a326,3m, up from \u00a312.4m, followed by Chelsea, who have also more than doubled their spending on agents' fees, up from \u00a312m to \u00a325.1m. Manchester United (\u00a319m) and Arsenal (\u00a310.2m) complete the top five, while Tottenham's outlay has risen from \u00a36m to \u00a37.2m. Yet despite being considered part of the Premier League's 'big six' clubs, Spurs trail behind West Ham (\u00a39.5m) and Bournemouth (\u00a37.4m) in agents' fees paid for 2016-17. Former England, West Ham and QPR winger Trevor Sinclair I was very fortunate. I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually. On top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself. The influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power. In relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for \u00a31m, why would there be another \u00a31m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football. Jonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group Agents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one. People get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter. However, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football. We get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly. Stoke City chairman Peter Coates Football clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised. I wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5%, 10% or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get. There are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market. They play the field, which they're entitled to, and it's not easy.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The amount paid by English clubs to agents has risen by 38% in a year - up from \u00a3160m to \u00a3220m.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blas\u00e9 attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation. He is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (\u00a30.7bn) a year in revenue. Dingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web. \"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article. \"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\" The Tor Project's website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don't kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do. \"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things. \"It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\" I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online. \"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists. \"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there.\" In layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid. \"As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor]. \"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\" Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing. \"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\" Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks\u2026 but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\" Given this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties. He is confident that funding will continue. \"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\" The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. \"About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says. \"Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing\u2026. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase.\" The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing. \"I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,\" he says. ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "When Roger Dingledine talks about the dark web, he waves his hands in the air - as if not quite convinced of its existence.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Scotland's early lead had gone, the sides were level at 1-1 and the frailties at the heart of their defence were evident again. \"It was a crisis,\" said the Scotland manager, earnestly. Crisis was a strong word to use, but it was Strachan's word and it was a revealing one. It spoke not just to the predicament his team were in against a nation ranked 176th in the world but also to Scotland's previous opening days in major championship qualification. The 0-0 draw against Lithuania that got the Euro 2000 campaign off to a grim start. The 2-2 draw against the Faroes in the first round of matches for Euro 2004. The 0-0 draw with Slovenia in week one of the qualifiers for World Cup 2006. The loss to Macedonia on the first day of the campaign to make the World Cup in 2010. The draw with Lithuania that put Scotland on the back foot straight away in the Euro 2012 qualifiers. The draw with Serbia that did the same for World Cup 2014. Scotland failed to qualify for all those tournaments, as if anybody needs reminding. \"Everybody was concerned,\" said Strachan, about half-time in Malta. \"But we had a bunch of lads who could deal with the stress.\" Scotland had enjoyed 72.5% possession in that opening half and their dominance of the ball wasn't reflected in a dominance on the scoreboard. This is not unusual when teams play Malta, but it's still unsettling at the time. Lots of possession doesn't always mean lots of goals. Malta can be slapstick but, on their very best days, they can also be stuffy. Strachan would have known that. Maybe that's where the mention of a \"crisis\" came from, a realisation that while the minnows don't win matches, they do have the capacity, from time to time, to frustrate. In the qualifiers for Euro 2016, Italy had 71% possession (and a one-man advantage for 46 minutes) against Malta and yet only scored once against them. In the return match, they had 70% possession and again they broke down their opponents only once. In the same group, Croatia had their issues with the Maltese. They, like Italy, had a one-man advantage, for 59 minutes, and enjoyed 70% of the ball but only scored twice, the second coming nine minutes from the end. In their second game with Malta, they had 64% possession and only won 1-0. Strachan had mentioned their stuffiness in the preamble. At half-time, that fear wouldn't have been far from his mind. In fairness to them, Scotland picked up the banana skin and flung it out of their road. At 2-1, they had retaken control of the game, then they benefited from a horrific refereeing error that gave them a penalty they didn't deserve, a decision that also unjustly reduced Malta to 10 men with half-an-hour left. In the Euro qualifiers, 10-man Malta managed to batten down the hatches against the 11 men of Italy and Croatia but they couldn't repeat the trick against Scotland. Strachan's team got seriously lucky with the penalty and the red card, but they made the most of it. Five goals is a hell of a return when so many would have settled for one, as long as it was decisive. What did Sunday night tell us? It told us that Strachan's favoured centre-halves, Russell Martin and Grant Hanley, had better start playing games for their clubs - they're out of the picture at Norwich and Newcastle - before the next round of qualifiers in October. In a worrying opening half the pair of them were rusty and vulnerable, even to the pea-shooters of Malta. It told us that Ollie Burke has a lot to offer, that in James McArthur's absence, Barry Bannan's surprise selection was justified and that in Leigh Griffiths' absence - and the increasingly perplexing omission of Ross McCormack - Chris Martin scored an important goal to make it 2-1. It also told us that Matt Ritchie's delivery from out wide could be invaluable. Above all, it reminded us that Robert Snodgrass is not just a terrific footballer, but he's also a fine leader - and if there was luck involved in his hat-trick then it was not before time. Injury robbed him of 16 months of his career. The man is due some payback. Scotland's record on the opening day of major championship qualifying campaigns is lamentable, but this team has spared itself the misery of its predecessors. They can look to Lithuania at Hampden on 8 October with a bit of confidence. Like the Malta game, that's a must-win. Lithuania drew 2-2 with Slovenia on Sunday having led 2-0 after 34 minutes. They're already weakened by that result. Scotland can deal them a major blow by beating them next month. Prepare to forget about qualification if they don't. We can only talk in ball-park numbers when trying to figure out how many points Scotland may need to make the play-offs - presuming that England, though hugely uninspired in victory against Slovakia, go on and win the group. Media playback is not supported on this device For the 2014 World Cup, Croatia, Iceland and France made the play-offs with 17 points. All the other nations that made the play-offs could have got there with 18, although some ended up with more than 18. Four years earlier, and because Scotland's group was so lamentably bad - Norway finished second with a feeble 10 points, 11 points would have got a team to the play-offs. That was a highly unusual campaign, though. Over those past two World Cup qualifying campaigns the 16 teams that advanced to the play-offs had an average of 20 points each. That's why home and away victories against Malta and Lithuania are vital. It's why Slovakia and Slovenia need to be beaten at some stage, home or away. Even then, Scotland may need to garner some draws to top up their total. Scotland have been a mile off that standard. In the last three World Cup qualifying series they finished on 11 points (2014), 10 points (2010) and 13 points (2006). Scotland being Scotland, even when they got off to a flier (Euro 2008 campaign) and had nine points out of nine (including a win over France) and 12 points from a possible 15 at the start, they still didn't make it. None of this will be easy, but it's not supposed to be. The encouraging thing is that, on Sunday, they leaped over the first hurdle, an obstacle they usually thunder into before crashing to the floor. The barriers only get bigger from here. But, then, the prize, is pretty huge, too.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The ghosts of failures past must have been swirling around Gordon Strachan's ears at half-time in Malta on Sunday night.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Bury, meanwhile, are now four points above the bottom four after taking 13 points from 15, with three straight wins since Lee Clark took charge.

{"article": "###\nArticle: More than a new way of playing video games, a cynic might say. Special Report: The Technology of Business Digital death of a business card? Mobile advertisers want your phone Rinsing your reputation the online way Mobile working comes of age Using voice to give your app the edge But Microsoft - a company that may well spend more on R&D than any other business - believes its strategy is paying off, and the proof is the XBox Kinect system. On a visit to the company's headquarters, I had a chance to see some of the projects that Microsoft scientists at its laboratories in Redmond, in Beijing and in Cambridge, England, believe will change the way we see computers. And the striking thing about what Microsoft's research chief Craig Mundie picked to show off to a group of technology journalists was that almost all of them involved Kinect. The system which turns a player's body into a games controller was developed with the help of seven different research groups at the company's three main labs, some working on voice recognition, others on motion sensors and a range of other technologies. Now they are looking at what Kinect could do next. We saw a system which would allow two people to see different images on the same screen, their eyes tracked by the Kinect camera. Other scientists showed off ways that the camera could capture objects and people in 3D, which might have applications in future telepresence systems. And there was plenty of work on avatars, for use in either games or in video-conferencing. Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he'll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person. Craig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft's R&D strategy is paying off. \"Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we've been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions,\" he says. \"You can't rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale.\" But Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs. Ever since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream. Peter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking. Professor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis. He cites the contribution to what he describes as the \"holy war in search\", the battle between Google and Microsoft's Bing. \"Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product.\" But he thinks the long-term research is equally important. \"Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge,\" he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize. His boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft's big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example. There is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where \"the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf.\" It is an intriguing vision, but here's a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line. Big, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft. \"We don't feel big and sleepy or dull,\" he responded, \"but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view.\" And he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end. \"I don't think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren't making these kind of investments. They'll come and go in a generation if they don't have the staying power that's produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies.\" Microsoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "If you spent $9bn a year on research and development and employed 900 of the world's top computer scientists to come up with new ideas, what would you expect in return?", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: With all the results now declared, Jac Larner of Cardiff University sums up the night for Wales' five main parties. WELSH LABOUR Labour have exceeded all expectations in Wales. They have outperformed every single Wales-only poll over the course of the campaign - and the exit poll - achieving their highest share of the vote in Wales since 1997. Not only did they successfully defend their 25 seats, but they gained three seats from the Conservatives, taking their total to 28 in Wales. This is their best performance in terms of seat share since 2005, and their best performance in terms of share of the Wales vote since the New Labour landslide of 1997. This extends their run of winning general elections in Wales to 26 in a row. WELSH CONSERVATIVES The Conservatives also saw their vote share increase across Wales by 6.3%, but this was not enough for them to hold off Labour's surge in Wales. Early in the night they were confident about gaining seats in Bridgend, Newport West and in the north east of Wales, so a net loss of 3 seats will be a big disappointment. Historically, the Conservatives have always performed worse in Wales than in England at every election going back to 1859, and this election looks to be no different. PLAID CYMRU It was a strange night for Plaid Cymru that ended in success with the election of their youngest ever MP, Ben Lake. They increased their parliamentary representation, taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, and their vote held up where they were defending the three seats won in 2015. Their group of four MPs is the party's largest Westminster cohort since the 2001 general election. Yet their vote share fell nationally by 1.7% and they lost votes in their other target seats of Ynys Mon, Llanelli and Rhondda. However, Plaid will view themselves as one of the few winners in this election on a night where smaller parties saw their vote share squeezed across the UK. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS The Liberal Democrats' torrid time at elections in Wales continues. They won their worst ever share of the vote in the party's history in Wales, and lost their solo MP Mark Williams in Ceredigion to Plaid Cymru. With only one AM in Wales, and limited representation in local government in Wales, the Liberal Democrats can no longer be considered to be a significant political player in the country. It is the first time since the founding of one of the Lib Dem's predecessor party, the Liberals, in 1859 that they will have no Westminster representation in Wales. UKIP UKIP's vote share has collapsed considerably across Wales, polling 11.6% less than 2015 after 38 constituencies had been called. Opinion polling across the campaign suggested that around two-thirds of the 2015 UKIP vote would go to the Conservatives. From the results we have seen so far, it seems that a significant proportion of these voters have voted for Labour in Wales.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "It has been a dramatic night that has confounded expectations of political parties and commentators.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Life took a dramatic turn for the teenager when he was diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Eve. He was due to have an operation on his appendix at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. However, doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller growths. The news shocked Josh's family, but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world. It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Elim Church, where Josh's father is on the pastoral staff, and has since gone viral. The church's senior pastor, Gary Beattie, said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far. \"We were in total shock when he was diagnosed, and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh,\" Gary said. \"It certainly isn't a campaign as such, we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him. We had no idea that it would take off. \"We would use social media quite a lot because we have quite a young congregation, and we've been posting updates about Josh from his family. \"The update was shared 948 times and it's been seen by over 79,000 people. It's absolutely phenomenal. \"We thought there had been a mistake, but you can look at the views and where they've come from, and there are people all over the world supporting him, which is great.\" But how did a social media hashtag lead to the appearance of the massive billboard? Gary said that last week a mystery donor paid for the sign and it was erected at Holywood playing fields. \"We do not know where it came from, we didn't put it there, but it means a lot to have such support,\" Gary said. There has also been a huge outpouring of support on Twitter for the Bangor Grammar pupil, with his classmates using the now-global hashtag for their friend.

The parade got under way in the West End with an increased visible police presence. For the first time, the Red Arrows will fly past the march and a rainbow flag is flying at Parliament. Justine Greening, Secretary of State for International Development, announced she is in a same-sex relationship as the event was in full swing. She tweeted: \"Today's a good day to say I'm in a happy same sex relationship, I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!\" Her announcement came as the director of Pride London, Michael Salter-Church, said this year's campaign slogan is No Filter.

At the scene: BBC reporter Catriona Renton What a carnival atmosphere! The buzz around the start of the parade was electric as we watched several people dressed as the character of Patsy from \"Absolutely Fabulous\" dancing on their bus with a giant high heeled shoe and lipstick on it. Then the real stars of the show Edina and Patsy herself cut the ribbon. Then they were off. Approximately 40,000 people from around 300 organisations paraded down Oxford Street in a sea of glitter and colour on their way to Trafalgar Square. There was silence as people here paused to remember the 49 victims of the shootings in Orlando who were killed two weeks ago. The message was of solidarity. The march takes place weeks after a gunman shot dead 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando in Florida. The Metropolitan Police said it will mount a visible police presence to provide reassurance to those taking part. Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe earlier said there was \"no intelligence\" to suggest the march or the city would be targeted, urging people to join in but \"take reasonable precaution\". Organisers expect that more people will attend the event this year to show support for the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender community.

He said: \"In the wake of the horrific mass murder of LGBT people by an Islamist gunman in Orlando, we are highlighting the need for dialogue, unity and solidarity between the Muslim and LGBT communities - to oppose all hate.\" This year the parade will feature more than 100 Met Police officers and 200 military personnel, as the flypast will show support within the Armed Forces for the LGBT community.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Tens of thousands of people have joined the Pride parade through central London.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

An off-duty police sergeant saw this and went to help the woman. When the sergeant tried to intervene, the defendant allegedly drove his car at the officer, forcing him to get out of the way. The sergeant was able to pull the keys from the ignition through the car's open window, but the defendant wrenched them from his grasp. He then drove to the Grand Parade area of east Belfast where the woman was released.

The Nato documents report how the UK claimed Rockall in 1955. The government feared that it could be used by \"hostile agents\" as a place to monitor the Hebrides Rocket Range. A small team of military personnel was taken to Rockall by the Royal Navy in September 1955 to claim as UK territory. A Union Flag was raised and a plaque installed on the rock. In the documents, it says: \"This decision of the UK government was connected with the fact that the UK government had recently decided to set up a guided missile range in South Uist, in the Outer Hebrides. \"The island of Rockall was uninhabited but this government wished to guard against the possibility of hostile agents installing themselves on the island in order to observe the effects of the tests on the South Uist range.\" People have stayed on Rockall, though only temporarily, in the past, including in 1997 when three campaigners from Greenpeace managed to climb on to the rock. They lived on Rockall for 42 days and renamed it Waveland in protest at exploration of new oil and gas reserves in the surrounding seabed. In 2014, a Scots adventurer broke the record for occupying the remote North Atlantic rock.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The UK Renewable Energy Roadmap says measures being introduced will \"ensure that low-carbon electricity from a diverse range of sources... becomes a more attractive choice for investors, delivering long-term change while minimising cost to the consumer\". In its UK Bioenergy Strategy, published in April 2012, the coalition government placed high importance on the role biomass can play, warning that excluding it from the energy mix would \"significantly increase the cost of decarbonising our energy system - an increase estimated by recent analysis at \u00c2\u00a344bn\". However, it added that ministers had a responsibility to ensure that \"policies only supported bioenergy use in the right circumstances\". The strategy document outlined four guiding principles that would underpin policy decisions, one of which stated: The UK introduced the Climate Change Act 2008, which obliges governments to deliver an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emission from 1990 levels by 2050. Experts agree that in order for this target to be met, the UK's energy infrastructure must drastically cut its carbon footprint. Outdoor laboratory In a Lincolnshire field, a team of scientists led by researchers from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) carried out a range of experiments on two bioenergy crops: miscanthus grass and short-rotation coppice willow. Natural England's guide to miscanthus (PDF) In their outdoor laboratory, they set out to measure how much atmospheric carbon the crops were able to lock in the soil. \"The big barrier as far as bioenergy crops are concerned is a fear of the unknown in terms of soil carbon losses or gains - this is the gap we are trying to fill,\" explained lead researcher Niall McNamara. \"At this field site, we are very lucky to have two key bioenergy crops growing side-by-side, which is allowing us to make a comparison of their effects on soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from the soil,\" he told BBC News. One of the experiments involves erecting three-metre high tents over a section of the crops, allowing the team to expose the plants to a \"carbon tracer\" - a form of carbon that is different from atmospheric carbon so it is possible for the researchers to track its movements from the surrounding air, through the plants and into the soil. \"This is added through the tent for about four to five hours,\" said Dr McNamara. \"During this time, it is fixed by the plants through photosynthesis. We then follow that carbon which has been fixed by the plant into the soil and into the microbes and back out of the soil.\" He added that the experiment would provide data on how novel crops, such as miscanthus, introduced carbon into the soil and how stable it was once it was in the ground. \"As you can see, miscanthus is very different from anything you would see normally,\" he observed. \"It originates from Asia and so there has not been a lot of work done on it and the carbon tracer approach is a very good way of seeing how much carbon fixed by the plant will stay in the soil a year later.\" Another experiment the team are carrying out involves taking a metre-deep soil sample, which co-researcher Rebecca Rowe describes as \"quite unusual\". \"A lot of soil science, at the moment, is done to about 30cm, partly for practical reasons as coring to a metre is difficult,\" she said. Digging deep In order to extract the metre-long sample, the team have to enlist the help of \"Kevin\", an adapted road-breaker. \"Also because a lot of arable crops or grassland crops the rooting depths are much shallower, a lot of the changes are happening in the top 30cm,\" Dr Rowe told BBC News. \"Obviously, with energy crops that are in the ground for 20-25 years, we are looking at a lot longer timescale and a greater depth for rooting so it is important for us to go deeper.\" Dr Rowe is 12 months into a three-year project that involves collecting metre soil samples all over the UK. \"We could just do it here at our Lincolnshire site, but then we would only be able to say what is happening with soil carbon in this location in this soil type,\" she explained. \"By going all over the country, we can look at different soil types and different climates - the South-West is very different  to, say, southern Scotland. \"It gives us a much better idea of what the overall effect on soil carbon may be in all of the sites across the UK with growing things like willow, miscanthus and different arable crops as well.\" (Source: UK Bioenergy Strategy) Dr McNamara said the data would be used to develop a model, developed by researchers from Aberdeen University and other partners, to show how growing bioenergy crops would affect an area of land's soil carbon characteristics. \"Our plan is to make a model universally available to the community, so a user could download our model and then - for example - predict what would happen if they converted their land to bioenergy crops in terms of the implication for soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. The project - commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute, with additional funding from the Natural Environment Research Council - would, Dr McNamara added, help address the concern over the scarcity of data on bioenergy crops and carbon cycling, and allow policymakers make informed decisions about the role bioenergy can play in delivering a low carbon UK energy mix.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Generation of electricity and heat from plant material is listed in the suite of renewable energy technologies that the UK governments think can help deliver 15% of the nations' energy consumption by 2020.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Its gloomier projection may be seen as a particular embarrassment for the Tories, given that unlike Labour and the Liberal Democrats they are committed to generating a surplus on the overall budget. However a small part of the forecasting difference between the IMF and the OBR is that the IMF assumes there will be a weakish minority government after the election and therefore spending will be a bit higher than the Tories' plan. So a senior Tory put a brave face on the IMF's disagreement with the OBR and said it showed the risks of voters not giving them a clear mandate. However that is not the whole story, in that the IMF also believes the OBR is being a bit too optimistic about growth and tax revenues in the latter years of the next parliament. In truth therefore the IMF is highlighting that whoever leads the next government may be forced to increase taxes or cut spending a bit more than currently planned. This may represent a bigger headache for the Tories than Labour or the LibDems given that in the last few days the Tories have committed themselves to \u00a36bn of tax cuts and \u00a38bn of increased spending on the NHS, without saying where the money for these giveaways would come from. In fact just yesterday a senior Tory pointed to the OBR's projected surplus for 2019/20 and said that would cover (almost) the NHS commitment. Well the IMF today says that \u00a37bn surplus is a chimera. All that said, the IMF forecast is a million miles from being devastating for any party: the difference between a \u00a37bn deficit and \u00a37bn surplus in 2020 is just 0.6% of GDP or national income - which is a rounding error in the context of a deficit that was a humongous 10% of GDP just five years ago.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The International Monetary Fund has today highlighted the challenge to be faced by the next government in returning the public finances to balance.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. \"Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest \u2026 is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,\" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. \"Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,\" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says \"the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. \"There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,\" he told BBC Sport. \"For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. \"For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all.\" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. \"Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,\" Bility wrote. \"If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down \u2026 with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes.\" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president.

{"article": "###\nArticle: James Warnock, 56, has been convicted of the \"horrifying\" killing of Yiannoulla Yianni, 17, in 1982. She was attacked while home alone in Hampstead, north London, the Old Bailey heard. Warnock, formerly of Harrington Street, north-west London, was 22 at the time, and had denied the charges. The case was one of the Met Police's unsolved murders before DNA samples from the scene matched to the former tiler in December last year. In a victim impact statement Yiannoulla's family said: \"For over half a lifetime we have had to live with the daily torture of what happened to our daughter and sister Lucy. \"All who knew her, loved and adored her. \"We now pray that we can move forward with the rest of our lives having some peace in knowing that her killer has been brought to justice and that a very dangerous man is no longer a threat to anyone else.\" It was not until 1999 that DNA could be extracted from the bedspread in the case. The court heard the Met Police got a \"lucky break\" in December when Warnock was arrested over indecent images of children and had to give a DNA sample. The sample was found to be a match to semen found at the murder scene. Reporting restrictions were lifted when Warnock admitted six indecent images offences relating to photos of young children and a baby in 2013 and 2015. Warnock had earlier described himself to the court as having been very slim with dark hair, styled like the actor John Travolta, at the time of the murder on 13 August 1982. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told the trial that Yiannoulla had been with her parents parents Elli and George Yianni at their shoe repair shop a short distance from their home on the day of the attack, but went home early to prepare supper. A man in his early 20s was spotted chatting with to her on the doorstep, before a neighbour heard a scream about 20 minutes later, the jury heard. Her parents returned home to find jewellery scattered on the stairs and called out to her, before finding her partially naked body on their bed. During the trial he claimed he had been in a sexual relationship with the schoolgirl after meeting her at the family's shop, but the court heard she was a virgin before the attack. Warnock was living about half-a-mile from Yiannoulla's house at the time of her death, the court heard. Police said he had continued to live in the community in the years since the attack. After the killing, a public appeal, including a televised reconstruction featuring the victim's sister Maria, went out but despite more than 1,000 people coming forward with information, no real suspects were identified. Following the verdict, Det Insp Julie Willats said: \"Lots of people came forward. Hundreds and hundreds of statements were taken over the years. \"I got a lucky break. It's the science that has solved this one for us.\" \"He must have known we would be coming for him. \"I'm sure Warnock thought he'd never be caught but historic murders such as this are never 'case closed'.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A man who described himself in court as looking like John Travolta has been found guilty of the rape and murder of a teenager 34 years ago.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The total expenditure over the two-year period came to \u00a34.3bn, which led to a gross value-added (GVA) boost to the economy of \u00a38.3bn. However, spending in London was three times the rest of the UK combined. The report said: \"The effect of initial BBC spending is 'multiplied' as it ripples through the economy from region to region and sector to sector (and to the employees of those sectors). This is known as the 'multiplier effect'.\" The BBC's chief economic and policy adviser Najma Rajah explained: \"The basic premise is that when the BBC spends a pound, the impact of that pound is 'multiplied' as that pound spent by the BBC creates value elsewhere in the economy. \"So, for example, if the BBC were to buy a camera from a supplier in Manchester, the camera supplier would receive some money in return for the camera. \"The camera company would then use the income generated from the sale of the camera to pay their suppliers for the components that went into the camera and to also pay their employees and so on.\" Rajah added: \"A really good example of how this multiplier effect works is when the BBC commissions a programme that is made by an independent television production. \"The programme might be filmed in Scotland using local runners, electricians, make-up artists etc. who are paid and then will spend their wages in Scotland to the benefit of the Scottish economy.\" The report revealed significant growth in the north of England following the opening of the new BBC North headquarters in Salford Quays, with GVA growing 19.7% to \u00a3391m. But in the Midlands, it fell 21.7% to \u00a3199m, while the south was down 18.8% to \u00a3699m and Wales dropped 6.2% to \u00a3276m. London saw the biggest expenditure of \u00a32.98bn - nearly three times as much as the rest of the UK combined - which in turn generated \u00a35.65bn GVA. John Tate, the BBC's director of policy and strategy, used the findings of the report to call on Ofcom to reverse its plans for a spectrum tax on broadcasters next year. In a blog post he wrote:  \"The wider benefit of the licence fee provides an extra reason for Ofcom to think again before it implements a spectrum tax next year: a levy on the spectrum broadcasters use to transmit their programmes. \"As well as hitting licence fee payers, such a tax would remove much-needed cash from the UK's creative sector.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The BBC generated more than \u00a38bn for the UK economy in 2011-12, almost twice its licence fee spend.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The Welshman did take frame 13, but China's Ding powered to victory. Two-time Crucible champion Williams only made two half-centuries, but said he was destined to lose from the moment he split his old tip. \"I got beat easily and, to be honest, deep down I knew I would so I cannot really grumble,\" said Williams, 41. \"I was playing, and feeling, brilliant. With the players left in, it was probably my best chance of winning the World Championship. \"But as soon as my tip split the night before I knew then that my chances were gone. It was almost impossible. It didn't matter who I played. \"He played good but in the first session, I feel, if I had my normal tip I would have been in front.\" Ding still had to take his opportunities and he did so in devastating style. Williams was so accustomed to sitting in his chair during a one-sided start to the evening session, that Ding had to remind his opponent to get up and go in for a break. The Welshman then joked that he had Ding \"rattled\" and his \"head had gone\" when he tweeted during the interlude.

And he sealed victory with little fuss, grabbing his 11th score of more than 50 on his way. \"I got some easy chances in the match because Mark had a lot of bad kicks,\" Ding said. \"And every player has a big problem if they have a new tip. \"I controlled the game, took my chances and made some good breaks.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Public Accounts Committee says there has been a \"systemic failing\" in support to young people leaving foster care or children's homes. Its chair Meg Hillier MP says young adults are \"let down by the system that's supposed to support them\". The government says it is committed to improving the lives of care leavers. The committee found outcomes for the 10,000 young people aged 16 or over who leave care each year are \"poor and worsening\". Its report says the quality and cost of support to care leavers \"varies unacceptably\" between local authorities. Ofsted has rated two-thirds of council care leaver services inadequate or requiring improvement, say the MPs. \"The scale of variability in the quality and cost of support, and a lack of understanding of what causes this, show that this is a systemic issue, rather than a problem in just a few local authorities,\" says the report. Young people must leave local authority care by their 18th birthday \"whereas 50% of all 22-year-olds still live at home\" it notes. These children have often had difficult lives with 62% in care because of abuse or neglect, it adds. \"Those leaving care may struggle to cope with the transition to adulthood and may experience social exclusion, unemployment, health problems, or end up in custody.\" Some 41% of 19-year-old care leavers were not in education, employment or training in 2014 compared with 15% of the age group as a whole, says the report. It welcomes government initiatives to improve the lives of care leavers and acknowledges more good practice is emerging but says there is more still to do. \"It's time the government reviewed its care leavers' strategy to make sure these young people get the full support they need,\" said Ms Hillier. The Department for Education should take formal responsibility for improving the system, the MPs urge. In particular they believe the DfE should improve care leavers' access to apprenticeships and training, suitable accommodation and better advice. Town Hall bosses said 40% cuts to their budgets meant providing care leavers with adequate support was \"becoming an increasing challenge\" which councils could not handle alone. \"We urgently need to see the whole system properly funded and joined up to ensure children and young people receive the support they need, when they need it,\" said Roy Perry, chairman of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People's Board. The Department for Education said its reforms would help care leavers make a successful transition to adulthood. These include giving every care leaver a personal adviser and allowing young people to continue to live with their foster families after 18, though councils complain funding for the latter is \"significantly underestimated\".

{"article": "###\nArticle: Such values are ill-defined and vulnerable to misinterpretation, argued Southend head teacher, Robin Bevan. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) voted to monitor the policing of the requirement, introduced in England by the government last year. Mr Bevan said he had concerns about how the values \"might be interpreted by a future right-wing government\". \"When it comes to the new requirement of promoting fundamental British values, including the role of law, here is one law that I would actively encourage you to disengage from\", Mr Bevan, head of Southend High School for Boys, urged the union's annual conference in Liverpool. The government brought in the requirement in the wake of the Trojan Horse allegations, which suggested there had been attempts by groups of hardline Muslims to take over schools in Birmingham. Earlier this month a committee of MPs said that apart from one incident in one school \"no evidence of extremism or radicalisation was found by any of the inquiries in any of the schools involved\". Requiring schools to promote \"fundamental British values\" could have \"unintended consequences\", according to the text of the motion debated by the conference in Liverpool. \"There is no one in this hall who would argue against the important role that schools and colleges play in promoting personal morality, in developing a sense of civic duty, in fostering engagement with our democratic structures or in embracing a wider global understanding,\" said Mr Bevan. He said schools and colleges had, for a long time, been required to deliver a broad and balanced curriculum addressing issues of behaviour and conduct and placing this within a developmental framework of spiritual, moral and cultural understanding. \"These provisions have existed without controversy for many years and are ample and effective.\" He accused the rules on British values as \"deeply ill-considered\" and \"political posturing\". \"In what way do fundamental British values differ, for example, from French or Swedish ones?\" They change over time, with women now \"allowed\" the vote, said Mr Bevan. \"If these fundamental British values change over time, we can hardly describe them as fundamental.\" But, he argued, the problem was not just one of definition. \"Just take one moment to imagine how fundamental British values might be interpreted by a future right-wing government, or a partner in that government.\" He said he was particularly concerned that Ofsted was being asked to gauge the views of students in order to assess how how well schools actively promote these values. There had already been cases of \"less-skilled inspectors\" doing this in a \"wholly-inappropriate way\", he told journalists later. In particular he was concerned about the difference between \"what is taught and what is learned\", with a proportion of every class apt to misunderstand or ignore lessons, be they about trigonometry or British values. \"I am not sure the government should ever be in the business of dictating values that should be taught in schools - but students should engage in those debates... plurality, that's the way it should be,\" said Mr Bevan.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Teachers should ignore rules on promoting \"fundamental British values\", a teachers' union conference has heard.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: It said a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that widened the definition of who was subject to the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards had led to a rise in cases. Services cannot cope, deadlines were \"routinely breached\" and the system should be replaced, the body reported. The government commissioned the report and said it would review the law. The Law Commission, an independent body which reviews laws in England and Wales, made several recommendations to improve the system. These included requiring all decision-makers to put greater weight on the person's wishes and feelings when making decisions under the Mental Capacity Act. When a vulnerable person - usually suffering from a severe learning disability or dementia - in a care home or hospital has limits put on what they can do or where they can go for their own safety, the institution must apply to the local council to authorise the deprivation of liberty. The deprivation of liberty safeguards (DoLS) should ensure that a care home, hospital or supported living arrangement only deprives someone of their liberty in a safe and correct way, and that this is only done when it is in the best interests of the person and there is no other way to look after them. The system, under the Mental Capacity Act, requires that the care arrangements are independently checked. A landmark ruling from the Supreme Court in 2014 - also referred to as the Cheshire West decision - widened the definition of who was subject to the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). This triggered an increase in the number of cases, which the commission said has left health and social care services \"unable to cope\". Official figures show that hospitals and care homes in England made 195,840 DoLS applications in 2015-16 - more than 14 times the 13,700 in 2013-14. The commission said the increased workload had resulted in a rising number of DoLS referrals that were not assessed and statutory timescales were \"routinely breached\". In England, out of the 195,840 DoLS referrals during 2015-16, only 43% were completed in the year, the commission said. Of those, only 29% were completed within the 21 day time-limit set in regulations. It affects vulnerable people with dementia and learning disabilities and their families. The Law Commission's report provided examples of cases where the current system did not work. Steven Neary, a young man with autism and learning disabilities, lived with his father, who reported in December 2009 that he was having difficult coping. The local authority arranged for Steven to stay in a residential support unit and his father agreed to an extended stay of a couple of weeks. But Steven was detained there by the local authority for a year, including a period when he was subject to the DoLS regime, and the Court of Protection held that Steven had been unlawfully detained. The court noted that the local authority did not properly discuss its concerns or its plans with Steven's father. The Law Commission is calling for the current system to be scrapped and replaced \"right away\". Law Commissioner Nicolas Paines QC said the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards were designed at a time when fewer people were considered deprived of their liberty and now it was \"failing\" people it was set up to protect. \"It's not right that people with dementia and learning disabilities are being denied their freedoms unlawfully,\" she said. \"There are unnecessary costs and backlogs at every turn, and all too often family members are left without the support they need.\" The commission wants to replacing the law with a new scheme called the Liberty Protection Safeguards. Its recommendations include: A Department of Health spokesman said it was \"committed\" to protecting the rights of vulnerable people, which is why it commissioned the review. \"We thank the Law Commission for its detailed work, and will be responding to these constructive recommendations in due course.\" The Department of Health said it provided \u00c2\u00a325m of additional funding for 2015/16 to local authorities to support them in managing the increase in DoLS applications.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "People with dementia and learning difficulties are being detained in care without checks due to a 'failing' law, the Law Commission has said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Giving people the right to buy their council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won her much support. But some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day. Here, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever. By Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News. The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies. It was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making it one of her first major pieces of legislation after she came to office in 1979. The number of people who bought their council house from their local authorities rose to 200,000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180,000 in 1989, her last full year as prime minister. Since the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants. The sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there. When Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock. Critics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply. The Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again. By Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News Before Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country. The page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls. The Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to \u00a31,000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to \u00a3100,000. On the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p. But Thatcher's chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax. To fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%. Within a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor With money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the \"feelgood factor\". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed. Restrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s. And, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window. Building societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete. The Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years. Mrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988. The new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired. The promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions. Compensating the victims cost the pensions industry \u00a311bn. More successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to \u00a36,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break. To complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa. The idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have \u00a3390bn salted away. By John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News Few senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement. She was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike. The Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job. Secret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day. In 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million. The miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police. In the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever. Unions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions. One of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News A policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics. The recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership. By the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later. This led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK. One of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986. The promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices. Anyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid. Privatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing. It also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies. Yet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s. In 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010. By Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News The impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK. The so-called \"Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange. The most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face. Big Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading. It also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.) Before Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor. Price competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm. At best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping. Big Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops. This, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses. Big Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares. But while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "During her years as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher revolutionised the economic fortunes of every person in the UK.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said: \"This discovery is another great example of the huge potential the future holds for the North Sea. \"With more effective collaboration, increased exploration activity and a commitment to maximising economic recovery, the overall value that the industry continues to generate for the wider economy can also be maximised. \"It is critical that current reforms to the regulatory and fiscal regimes applying in the North Sea are expedited and prioritised with a view to ensuring the economic viability of projects such as these, and to realising the opportunities for development of the vast remaining resources in the North Sea.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Oil firms BP and GDF Suez have announced the discovery of a new field in the UK Central North Sea.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

We are now focusing elsewhere.\" Team principal Christian Horner said he was doing \"necessary due diligence\" in talking to other manufacturers. With their partnership with Renault disintegrating, the team may be forced to switch to Ferrari engines. Mercedes are understood to be against supplying Red Bull - who are contracted to Renault until 2016 - because they do not want to help a strong rival become more competitive. Media playback is not supported on this device The German giant is also concerned about what it and many other F1 insiders perceive to be Red Bull's history of antagonistic relationships with engine partners. Red Bull's relationship with Renault has been difficult for some time, and appears to have become untenable in recent months as the team's frustrations with the lack of competitiveness of the French engine boil over.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Carnival Triumph docked in Mobile, Alabama, at 21:15 (03:15 GMT Friday). Disembarking the passengers took more than four hours and many still faced a long bus journey to New Orleans or to the port of departure, Galveston. Passengers had reported sewage on the floors, poor sanitation and lack of access to toilets. Some lined the decks as the 900ft (275m) ship docked, waving and cheering at people on shore. Chants of \"Let me off, let me off!\" could be heard coming from the ship as they waited to disembark. One homemade sign read: \"Sweet Home Alabama!\" and another: \"The ship's afloat, so is the sewage.\" Disembarking passenger Brittany Ferguson said: \"I'm feeling awesome just to see land and buildings. The scariest part was just not knowing when we'd get back.\" Carnival Corp, which operates the ship, was also the owner of Costa Concordia, the cruise ship that ran aground off the Italian coast and sank last year, killing 32 people. On Thursday, tugboats began pulling the vessel to a shipyard for repairs. The Carnival Triumph took six hours to be towed through the 30 mile (50km) channel to Mobile - the largest ship ever to dock there. One passenger, Clark Jones, told the BBC the last day was \"especially nightmarish because we knew we were so close to land and getting off\". The passengers were taken by bus either to Galveston in Texas, which is about seven hours away, or to New Orleans, where the firm said it had booked 1,500 hotel rooms. New Orleans is two hours away. One bus broke down as it carried passengers to New Orleans, local media reported. Carnival chief executive Gerry Cahill apologised again for the \"very poor\" conditions on board. \"We pride ourselves on providing our guests with a great vacation experience, and clearly we failed in this particular case,\" he said. Hospitality staff will be sent on early holiday with full pay or transferred to other ships, depending on the length remaining in their contracts, senior vice-president Terry Thornton said. Passenger Janie Baker told NBC by phone on Thursday that conditions on the ship were \"extremely terrible''. There was no electricity and few working toilets, she said. Ms Baker described using plastic bags to go to the toilet and that she had seen a woman pass out while waiting for food. The stench from overflowing toilets and drainpipes made some cabins uninhabitable and many people slept in corridors, while others took bedding out into the open to escape the heat and foul smell. Passengers will be offered a full refund and discounts on any future cruises. Carnival announced on Wednesday passengers would each get an additional $500 (\u00c2\u00a3322) in compensation.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Division One leaders Middlesex, who were bowled out for 381 at Taunton to lead by 145, looked in charge when they reduced Somerset to 59-3 and 126-4. But Trescothick, who made 124, and Trego, still there on 115, shared 181 to leave the contest in the balance. Somerset closed on 348-6, an advantage of 203 runs. On a surface that has become easier for batting as the game has progressed, the outcome seems likely to rest on the length of time Trego spends at the crease on the final day. Somerset would perhaps want to post a target in excess of 250, while anything less would probably leave Middlesex as favourites. That the home side, who at one stage looked set to be defeated inside three days, are still in with a shout is down entirely to Trescothick and Trego. Opener Trescothick had seen Johann Myburgh bowled offering no shot to Harry Podmore and captain Chris Rogers shovel the same bowler to point for a duck. After James Hildreth was caught at slip from the off-spin of Ollie Rayner, Trescothick found some support from James Allenby, but when he mistimed a pull to mid-on, Somerset were still 19 behind. But Trescothick, playing characteristically powerful cover drives, and Trego, who capitalised as the Middlesex bowlers often dropped short, compiled their huge fifth-wicket stand to drag the hosts back into it. Trescothick's 48th Somerset hundred took him past Sir Viv Richards to second on the all-time list, while Trego completed his 14th first-class ton. Only when James Harris found some late energy did he have both Trescothick and Craig Overton caught behind, leaving Alex Barrow to accompany Trego to the close. Harris was earlier the last Middlesex wicket to fall, caught at slip off Tim Groenewald for 78, missing a maiden first-class hundred, just like James Fuller, who fell to the same combination for 93.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Marcus Trescothick and Peter Trego both made centuries to drag Somerset back into contention with Middlesex on day three of the County Championship match.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The report, revealed in The Guardian, was ordered by the government after claims some Muslim groups were trying to take control in some schools. The Department for Education has said it will not comment on the leaks. Birmingham council has released its own report, disagreeing with Mr Clarke. We must acknowledge today that Ian Kershaw's report shows we have serious governance issues in a small number of schools in east Birmingham because of serious malpractice by members of governing bodies. This has been compounded by the inability of head teachers and other governors to counter this behaviour and by the failure of the city council to intervene to instil proper governance. Council response in full Trojan Horse 'plot' schools timeline Reaction to 'Trojan Horse' reports The government's report was compiled by retired senior police officer Peter Clarke, the former head of the Met Police's counter-terrorism unit. It is due to be published next week. It says he found evidence of \"sustained and co-ordinated agenda to impose upon children in a number of Birmingham schools the segregationist attitudes and practices of a hardline and politicised strain of Sunni Islam\". He also found evidence of a \"co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamist ethos into some schools in the city\". The agenda would have confined \"schoolchildren within an intolerant, inward-looking monoculture that would severely inhibit their participation in the life of modern Britain,\" the leaked report says. A spokesman for the DfE said: \"The allegations made in relation to some schools in Birmingham are very serious and we are investigating all evidence put to us in conjunction with Ofsted and Birmingham City Council.\" Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said his union was disturbed by the Clarke review findings but not surprised. They reflected concerns raised in May about improper governance and staffing and \"a narrowing of entitlement for children\", he said. \"We do not need an over-reaction. This is not a criticism of the Islamic faith, but of a narrow current within it,\" he said. Birmingham's report, compiled by former head teacher Ian Kershaw, differed in its conclusions. It said there was \"no evidence of a conspiracy to promote an anti-British agenda, violent extremism or radicalisation in schools\" in the east of the city. Mr Kershaw did find \"key individuals\" promoting Islamic principles in schools and \"noted a pattern of these individuals moving between schools\". He did not conclude whether the original \"Trojan Horse\" letter was a hoax, as has been claimed. An unhelpful epitaph for Gove'Islam plot': Will we ever learn the truth? But he found evidence that the \"five steps\" outlined in the original letter as a means of destabilising school leadership were \"present in a large number of the schools considered part of the investigation\". His report said evidence pointed to a group of \"British male governors and teachers, predominantly of Pakistani heritage\", which have formed in order to address perceived failings in some schools. Mr Kershaw said the tactics employed by these groups were often \"improper\" and there was a \"pattern\" to their behaviour but it stopped short of a widespread plot. He said their motivation seemed to be an attempt to \"raise standards\" based on a \"genuine and understandable desire...to improve education and opportunities for Muslim pupils. \"The evidence is not sufficient to lead me to construe the behaviour to be a co-ordinated plan to improperly influence the direction or management of schools serving students of predominantly Islamic faith or background,\" he said. Mr Kershaw also says Birmingham City Council was \"slow to respond\" to allegations in the letter and accused education chiefs in the city of \"poor oversight\". He identifies a \"culture within [the council] of not wanting to address difficult issues and problems with school governance\" for risk of bringing accusations of racism or Islamophobia. Speaking at a press conference earlier, Council leader Sir Albert Bore admitted the council failed to act for fear of being seen as racist or Islamophobic. Last month, Ofsted and the Education Funding Agency published their reports and five schools were placed in special measures as a result. The schools involved have always denied any wrongdoing. On Tuesday, the board of trustees resigned at Park View Education Trust, which has been at the centre of claims, stating they had been the victims of a \"co-ordinated and vicious\" attack. The trust has been the focus of allegations made in the anonymous Trojan Horse letter alleging the existence of a clique of hardline Muslims attempting to seize control of Birmingham schools.  The origin of the letter and the intentions behind it have never been determined.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A leaked report into the so-called \"Trojan Horse\" plot has found evidence there was an agenda to introduce \"an intolerant and aggressive Islamist ethos\" into some Birmingham schools.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Handing over an envelope containing 50,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) ($2.4, \u00c2\u00a31.6) did not do the trick, but when she added another 50,000 VND, the referral was secured. The 33-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, then gave an envelope containing 500,000 VND ($24, \u00c2\u00a316) to the medical staff at the provincial hospital, an amount that was more than two months of her income. \"All other patients told me that everyone must give envelopes to thank the doctors and nurses for the treatment, and that was the rate for such an operation,\" she said. The staff did not ask for it but she believed that by giving the envelope her son would receive better care. She is not alone. Mrs Phin, a pensioner from a Hanoi suburb who lives on 3m VND per month, handed over an envelope containing 200,000 VND after eye treatment in hospital. But she was sent home before the treatment was complete. So she was admitted to hospital again and that meant another thank-you envelope. \"It cost me another 200,000 VND to thank the doctors and nurses. I could only afford the smallest amount suggested by other patients,\" she said. Mrs Luyen, a retired teacher from a small town 35km outside of Hanoi, said passing over a cash gift for medical treatment was effectively mandatory. \"Not all doctors ask for the envelopes but giving envelopes is a must when you go to hospital. It's in our culture,\" she said. In Vietnam, medical treatment is mostly subsidised by the state via an insurance system free to civil servants and children, or paid for privately or by employers. But queues for treatment under insurance cover are long and public hospitals overcrowded, while salaries for much of the medical profession remain low. And with growing capitalist sentiment meeting entrenched Confucian values, the practice of handing over a cash-filled envelope to secure faster or better service has become widespread. The number of people who gave envelopes doubled in the three years from 2007-2010 - from 13% to 29%, one study showed. In 2012, a survey published by the World Bank and Vietnam's Government Inspectorate (which runs the Anti-Corruption Bureau) showed that 76% of those who had paid a bribe to health service personnel did so voluntarily, with only 21% responding to a request. In an effort to fight corruption, five big hospitals in Hanoi launched a campaign in October 2011 to bolster ethical behaviour among staff, including a \"Say no to envelopes\" policy. Vietnam's Research and Training Centre for Community Development (RTCCD) also conducted a similar campaign to change perceptions of informal payments, using the media to raise patients' awareness of their rights as well as of doctors' duties. Nguyen Huu Ngoc, a well-known scholar in Hanoi, said the root of the problem lay in the Confucian gift-giving tradition. \"In Vietnamese society as well as in Chinese, gifts stem from gratitude,\" the scholar said. \"Showing gratitude used to have more spiritual value than material value. But over the years, it has become more material and less spiritual, and now in the market economy it is like a transaction.\" Culture might be used to justify the payments - but culture can be changed, according to Soren Davidsen, a senior governance specialist at the World Bank in Hanoi. \"We know gift-giving is an important part of culture. But we also know that culture is not a static but dynamic thing. Several countries in East Asia, such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan, have a culture of corruption, yet these countries have found effective ways to curb corruption. \"Although there is often the perception about culture being a part of corruption, we think that this is the wrong way of looking at it. And we can, by involving people, businesses and government in partnership, actually change culture,\" said Mr Davidsen. For many people, the line between a gift and a bribe has become blurred - something some people embrace as \"an excuse to give envelopes\", said Tran Thu Ha, vice-director of RTCCD. But for people who campaign to stop the practice like her, it is easy to identify what is a gift and what is a bribe. \"A gift can be given in public or anywhere, it needs time to talk and to say thank you, whereas a bribe is often given very quickly and both the giver and the receiver are afraid of being seen by other people,\" Ms Ha said. But to change people's behaviour is one of the big difficulties that Vietnam is facing and will take time, acknowledged Mr Ngo Manh Hung, deputy director-general of Vietnam's Anti-Corruption Bureau. There has been considerable debate about how to curb the practice in the health service. One suggestion is raising health workers' salaries so that they stop accepting envelopes. But that alone will not be enough. Associate Professor Ta Van Binh, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, believes that the government needs clear rules and tough punishments for medical staff who break them. But work also needs to be done to help patients understand that they do not need to give envelopes - and may themselves be breaking the rules if they do. Nguyen Huu Ngoc even thinks that there should be sanctions applied to patients who give envelopes to help clean up the industry. But this would need co-operation from all sides - patients, health workers and the authorities - and remains a big task. \"It's not an easy thing to do because corruption is about money, people and power,\" said Mr Davidsen of the World Bank. \"It's a huge challenge curbing corruption and co-ordinating anti-corruption efforts across government agencies. It is not a quick fix and can't be done overnight.\" There will be a series of special reports and articles this week as the BBC examines why bribes and backhanders are part of the system in so much of the world, looks at countries which have tried to roll back the tide - and explains how corruption works.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Three months ago, a woman from a village south of Hanoi needed her son referred to a provincial hospital by a district doctor for an operation.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Mr Filmus told the BBC the companies were \"performing illegal acts by entering Argentine territory\". He added: \"I want to make it clear for the directors of these companies and for British public opinion that Argentina will use the full force of the law - both national and international law - to prevent these countries from taking the riches which belong to 40 million Argentine citizens. \"Argentina has extradition treaties around the world and we intend to use them.\" He added that the area being drilled was \"as much ours as the centre of Buenos Aires. Neither the UK nor any other country would allow anyone to enter their territory and take away their riches.\" In response, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond accused the Argentines of \"outrageous bullying\". He said the islanders had a \"perfect right to develop their own economic resources and Argentina needs to stop this kind of behaviour and start acting like a responsible member of the international community\". The Falklands Islands government also said the Argentines had no case. \"We have the right to develop our economy, including the hydrocarbons industry, and we are exercising that right,\" it said. \"It is worth remembering that it was the government of Argentina who walked away from working with the Falkland Islands on the development of a hydrocarbons industry some years ago. \"Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands and this latest action is clearly another attempt by Argentina to try to block economic growth in the Falkland Islands.\" Analysts suggested Argentina would have little joy in the courts. \"The Argentines will lose,\" Malcolm Bracken at Redmayne Bentley told the BBC. \"They have no jurisdiction - the UN settled the matter in 1982.\" In fact, he said the country's current position would prove counterproductive. \"All they're doing is handing any possible benefit that Argentina may have had from the oil boom in the south Atlantic to Chile. \"There'd be an awful lot of logistic support needed for drilling that simply isn't available in the Falklands. They'd need a port somewhere and that's likely to be near Chile rather than Argentina, so they're cutting their own nose off to spite their face.\" Earlier this month, Argentine foreign ministry officials said they would prosecute oil companies operating near the Falkland Islands. The officials said companies active there were operating illegally in Argentine territory. This came after the three British oil companies announced new oil and gas finds north of the islands, and as Argentina marked the 33rd anniversary of the war with the UK over the islands.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Emma Morano was born on 29 November 1899 in the Piedmont region of Italy. She was officially the last person born in the 1800s still living. She had attributed her longevity to her genetics and a diet of three eggs a day, two of them raw. Ms Morano was the oldest of eight siblings, all of whom she has outlived. She died at her home in the northern city of Verbania. Her life not only spanned three centuries but also survived an abusive marriage, the loss of her only son, two World Wars and more than 90 Italian governments. Ms Morano had admitted that her longevity was partly down to genetics: her mother reached 91 and several sisters reached their centenary. But it was also down to a rather unusual diet of three eggs - two raw - each day for more than 90 years. It was a regime she took up as a young woman, after the doctor diagnosed her with anaemia shortly after World War One. She had cut down to just two eggs a day, and a few biscuits recently. Her doctor of 27 years, Carlo Bava, had told AFP news agency that she rarely ate vegetables or fruit. \"When I met her, she ate three eggs per day, two raw in the morning and then an omelette at noon, and chicken at dinner.\" Ms Morano also credited her longevity to her decision, in 1938, to kick out her husband - a year after her baby boy died at just six months old. The marriage had never been healthy, she said. She had been in love with a boy who was killed during World War One, and had no interest in marrying someone else. But, she told La Stampa newspaper in an interview when she was a spritely 112 that she was left with little choice. \"He told me: 'If you're lucky you marry me, or I'll kill you'. I was 26 years old. I got married.\" Eventually, it became too much. Though they separated in 1938, they remained married until he died in 1978. Ms Morano, who worked until she was 75, chose never to marry again. \"I didn't want to be dominated by anyone,\" she told the New York Times. She had only taken on a full-time carer a couple of years ago - but had not left her small two-room apartment for 20 years.

{"article": "###\nArticle: She is in possession of WTA ranking points once again after proving too strong for Roberta Vinci in her first match since a 15-month ban for taking the banned drug meldonium. There were errors, of course, and her movement is a work in progress, but she served strongly and returned with aggressive intent: hitting nearly twice as many winners as unforced errors. And she played with sheer bloody mindedness, in the way she always has. The Stuttgart crowd was respectful of Sharapova, and generous in her moment of victory, although the real warmth was reserved for her opponent. This first win will move the former world number one to the cusp of the top 500, but her ambitions for the week will stretch further, given the way she played and the frailties of some of the top seeds. Defeats for both Agnieszka Radwanska and Garbine Muguruza mean Sharapova cannot face a seeded player before the semi-finals. The top players in the women's game remain maddeningly inconsistent, and with Serena Williams pregnant, Victoria Azarenka on maternity leave and Petra Kvitova still recuperating from December's stabbing, there are opportunities galore. Sharapova is a five-time Grand Slam champion, and a likely future champion. This may be her 15th year on tour, but she has missed more time than most due to shoulder problems, as well as the ban. And rest did Roger Federer no harm before the Australian Open in Melbourne, when he clinched his 18th Grand Slam title after a six-month injury lay-off. She has won Slams on all surfaces and is brimming with motivation on her return from what she considers an unduly harsh ban imposed for an administrative error. And mentally, she is stronger than anyone bar Serena Williams. But it will probably take time. Stringing together seven wins in a row at a Grand Slam is notoriously difficult when you lack match practice and sharpness, and Sharapova may have to negotiate an extra three matches of qualifying at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. This was one of the main themes of her first news conference with regular tennis writers for 15 months. I thought she seemed nervous, quite frosty and was confrontational at times. \"I'm not getting a wildcard to receive a trophy or a golden platter,\" she said when asked about the numerous tournament invitations which have upset so many of her peers. \"I have to get through the matches and I still have to win them and that's my job.\" Caroline Wozniacki and Radwanska are just two players to have questioned why a player returning from a doping ban is being offered so many wildcards. The former world number one and number two were dismissed as \"journeyman\" players by Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud. \"I don't control my manager's words,\" Sharapova said when asked for her response, and then made no attempt to distance herself in the slightest from the sentiments. \"I'm sure he's been watching everyone's comments in the previous 15 months and he's entitled to his own opinion.\" Sharapova's lack of camaraderie has never held her back in the past, and she still has no desire to form friendships on tour. That wouldn't help her tennis, she pointed out. The locker room is where you go for an ice bath, she argued. Her true friends can be found away from the workplace. Sharapova would love to be at Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year, and she says she would be \"prepared to play in the juniors\" if it helped. She would need to reach the final here in Stuttgart to earn sufficient ranking points to gain direct entry into the qualifying draw of the French Open. If she fails to do so, her fate will be revealed to great fanfare on the evening of Tuesday 16 May, when wildcards for both qualifying and the main draw will be announced on Facebook Live. The All England Club is unlikely to go down the same route. Officially, wildcard recipients will not be determined until Tuesday 20 June, by which time Sharapova could be back in the top 100 and eligible for the main Wimbledon draw. To do so she will need to earn close to 600 ranking points from this week and her next two tournaments in Madrid and Rome.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Mr Hollande, whose party was beaten by the far right in last week's European Parliament election, said the EU had become too complex and remote. In response, he will tell EU leaders at a meeting in Brussels later that they must focus on boosting the economy. The three big pro-EU centrist blocs are still on course for a majority. But they have lost seats in the European Parliament to parties seeking to curb EU powers or abolish the union, among them the UK Independence Party which came first in the domestic vote with 27% according to provisional results. In France, the far-right National Front stormed to victory with a preliminary 25% of the vote, pushing Mr Hollande's Socialists into third place. National Front President Marine Le Pen said on Tuesday that her party would use its electoral mandate to \"defend France\"  and fight \"crazy measures like votes for immigrants\". The BBC's Matthew Price in Brussels says she made a direct challenge, not just to French politicians, but to Brussels too - saying it must listen to the people, and that the French had to protect their nation. This agenda will affect policy-making in the EU in the coming years, our correspondent says. Full coverage of results Speaking on French TV, Mr Hollande - a leading champion of the EU - said the project had become \"remote and incomprehensible\", and that that had to change. \"Europe has to be simple, clear, to be effective where it is needed and to withdraw from where it is not necessary,\" he said. He said the union had overcome the crisis in the eurozone \"but at what price? An austerity that has ended up disheartening the people\". When European Union leaders meet on Tuesday he would \"reaffirm that the priority is growth, jobs and investment\", he said. Matthew Price, BBC News, Brussels Europe has not \"voted against the EU\". The vast majority of those who bothered to cast a ballot did so for parties that are pro-EU, and they will make up the majority in the new parliament. Yes, the focus is understandably on France and the UK, with Denmark, Greece, and others also giving Euro-enthusiasts cause for concern. However in many countries mainstream parties dominated - in Germany, Italy, Poland where it was felt a growing Eurosceptic movement could break through, in the Netherlands and elsewhere. So the results do not constitute a \"problem\" as such for the leaders of the EU. Many leaders will point this out around the dinner table tonight. Others, however, will stress that a sizeable chunk of voters chose parties that want \"Brussels\" to change, and that the EU needs to address this issue if it is to maintain popular support and legitimacy in the longer term. Ahead of this election most leaders were not planning to come to Brussels to discuss how to reset their country's relationship with the EU. David Cameron was of course - but others were not. Will others - under domestic pressure - now join him? Anti-EU forces overshadow Brussels talks Mrs Merkel - whose conservative Christian Democratic Union won a comfortable 35% of the vote in Germany - said it was now up to the established parties of Europe to win voters back by focusing on \"improving competitiveness, on growth and creating jobs\". \"This is the best answer to the disappointed people who voted in a way we didn't wish for,\" she said. Elsewhere in Europe, the anti-EU UKIP was celebrating winning 27% of the vote, marking the first time in a century that a party other than the Conservatives or Labour has won any UK election. Prime Minister David Cameron, whose Conservative party lost seven seats, said it was clear voters were \"deeply disillusioned\" with Europe and that the message was \"received and understood\". But he insisted he would neither bring forward the date of an in/out referendum on UK withdrawal from the EU - scheduled for 2017 - nor seek a pact with UKIP. Despite the unprecedented Eurosceptic gains across the Union, Jose Manuel Barroso, outgoing president of the European Commission, insisted that the pro-EU blocs still had \"a very solid and workable majority\". The centre-right European People's Party appears set to win 213 out of the 751 seats, with 28.36% across the bloc, according to estimated results issued by the European Parliament. That would mean it remains the biggest group - but with more than 60 seats fewer than before. The Socialist alliance has a projected 190 seats, with 25.3% of the vote, the Liberals 9% and the Greens 7%. The Eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy group appeared to have around 38 seats - including the 24 for UKIP. But the number of non-attached right-wing MEPs is set to rise, boosting the Eurosceptic camp. Mr Barroso said a \"truly democratic debate\" was needed to address the concerns of those who did not vote, or \"voted in protest\". Turnout across Europe is estimated at 43.1%, the first time it has not fallen since the previous election - but it has only increased by 0.1%. Result highlights (from European Parliament website): The election is the biggest exercise in multi-national democracy in the world, affecting the lives of the EU's 500 million citizens.

{"article": "###\nArticle: He said the target to cut net migration to the UK could not be achieved as long as Britain remained a member of the EU. Launching UKIP's campaign poster on immigration, Mr Farage said an \"honest debate\" on the subject was needed to restore public trust in politics. The Conservatives said UKIP's immigration policy was in \"chaos\". Speaking in Dover, Mr Farage told the gathered media that the other parties were making false promises on immigration during the election campaign. But he said the only solution to controlling immigration was to leave the EU - which UKIP campaigns for. The prime minister pledged in 2011 to reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK to levels last seen in the 1990s, about \"tens of thousands\" each year. But the target has not been met, with the latest figures showing net migration rose to 298,000 for the year ending in September 2014 - higher than when he came to office. Nigel Farage swept in and out of a blustery press call in the shadow of the white cliffs of Dover. The UKIP leader - helped along by a backdrop of party activists - unveiled a poster attacking the Conservatives' record on immigration, in response to which they said UKIP's policy was in \"chaos\". An initially well-behaved press pack soon descended into a gentle scrum, with Mr Farage directed towards one camera then another for a series of interviews. He announced new target immigration figures, was challenged over his views on migrants with long-term illnesses and set an ambitious timeframe to get immigration down. Then, time for a coffee - not a pint - in a local pub before Mr Farage was whisked away again. A picturesque media opportunity, but one that revealed little more about UKIP's immigration policy other than the obvious fact it is central to their campaign. The symbolic location, with the shadow of France on the horizon, was deliberately chosen by Team UKIP to keep Britain's relationship with the continent at the forefront of people's minds. Although - perhaps ironically - it also caused some mobile phones to switch to French networks in order to function. Downing Street said the rise has been driven in part by Britain's economic success relative to its neighbours in the eurozone. Labour said the government's pledge was \"in tatters\". But, unveiling UKIP's campaign advert, Mr Farage said: \"When Cameron made that promise he was being wilfully dishonest. \"Because he knew the truth and I think now the British public, five years on, know the truth: that you actually cannot have an immigration policy, you can't set targets of any kind at all, you can't attempt to control who comes into Britain all the while you're members of the European Union.\" He issued a call for a \"return to normality\", saying net immigration - the difference between the number of people leaving the UK and the number coming in - should be brought down to about 30,000 people per year. Charlie Elphicke, Conservative candidate in Dover, accused Mr Farage's party of performing U-turns on immigration policy. \"All we've seen from UKIP on immigration is chaos and confusion: one minute there's a cap, then there's not. Mark Reckless says certain migrants should be repatriated, then Farage says they're welcome to stay,\" he said. I am not sure if it is by design or if he just wants a slow start, but two days in to this general election campaign and UKIP leader Nigel Farage appears to be taking it easy. Or at least that is how it seems. This is a candidate who has to win on 7 May. If he fails to become the next MP for South Thanet he has said he will quit as leader. Yet I have seen no door-knocking. Our cameras have not been told of any public event, yet. We have had two poster-unveiling ceremonies with impromptu leader interviews. He arrives, he speaks, he answers questions, then he leaves. Read more from Robin. The EU, and the UK's place within it, is set to be a major issue in the election campaign. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU and put it to a public vote in 2017, if the Conservatives win in May. Labour has said it does not support an in/out referendum, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said his party would not \"play footsie\" with the idea of leaving the EU - although he has refused to say he would block a referendum as part of any coalition deal. The Financial Times has reported the Lib Dems would only agree to support a poll if the franchise was extended to EU migrants resident in the UK and 16- and 17-year-olds. The party is also said to want to have a say on the wording of the question and the timing of the vote. In response, UKIP's economic spokesman and campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn accused Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg of preparing to \"rig\" a referendum if they are in power together again. He said it would be \"profoundly unfair\" to allow UK-based EU nationals to participate, and claimed the idea to give younger people a vote was designed to sway the result towards an \"in\" vote.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "David Cameron was \"wilfully dishonest\" when he pledged to cap immigration to the tens of thousands, UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The home secretary and Tory leadership candidate told the Daily Mail it would be \"sheer madness\" to give up the UK's nuclear deterrent because of the threat posed by countries including Russia. Renewing Trident would show Britain was \"committed\" to working with Nato allies after voting for Brexit, she added. Labour is split over Trident, with Jeremy Corbyn opposing its renewal. Mrs May, seen as the front runner in the contest to replace David Cameron, said there was a \"rapidly changing terrorist threat\" from groups including so-called Islamic State and Boko Haram. But she disputed the suggestion this meant the UK no longer needed a nuclear deterrent, saying the UK still faced threats from \"conventional enemies\". Mrs May said this included Russia, which had showed \"renewed beligerence\" in its annexation of Crimea, and North Korea, which she said \"continues to defy international law with its nuclear programme\". Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans. The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction. The submarines carry up to eight Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads. Read more about the history of the UK's nuclear weapons system Pledging to make a \"strong defence an important priority\" if she is elected leader of the Conservatives, Mrs May wrote: \"In the face of such strong evidence, it would be sheer madness to contemplate even for a moment giving up Britain's independent nuclear deterrent. \"And there is no room for compromise, and no room for cheese paring. \"We need a full fleet of four submarines, capable between them of providing what the military call 'Continuous At Sea Deterrence', or permanent, around-the-clock cover. \"Doing so will send an important message that, as Britain leaves the European Union, we remain committed to working alongside our Nato allies and playing our full role in the world.\" Parliament is to hold a vote later this year on whether to proceed with building successor submarines to the existing Vanguard fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade. Mrs May said the vote should take place before the Commons summer break begins on 21 July, adding \"we should get on with getting it built\". She said: \"A lot of parliamentary business has, for obvious reasons, been put on hold until the leadership election is complete and a new prime minister is in post. \"But when it comes to the nuclear deterrent, the national interest is clear, the Conservatives are united, and we have waited long enough.\" Labour has become split over the renewal of Trident following the election of leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is a life-long opponent of nuclear weapons. Mr Corbyn is at odds with many of his MPs over the future of the UK nuclear weapons system - which the government has estimated will cost \u00c2\u00a331bn to renew - and has commissioned a review led by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry to look at its future, likely to report in the summer. He has previously suggested the UK could keep its Trident submarine fleet but without carrying nuclear warheads. The Conservative leadership contest was sparked by Mr Cameron's decision to step down as prime minster after the UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU, in the June referendum. The other candidates are energy minister Andrea Leadsom, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb and former defence secretary Liam Fox.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Local authorities can apply for funds to support weekly collections, as well as for initiatives offering residents reward vouchers for recycling rubbish. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who announced the scheme last autumn, calls weekly bin collections a \"basic right\". But Labour's Hilary Benn says the funding would be better spent on children's centres and elderly care. Mr Pickles scrapped guidance telling councils to introduce fortnightly collections in a bid to reverse a trend developed under Labour. He will say later that rubbish collections are the \"most visible service\" paid for through council tax. \"Labour's barmy bin rules have made putting out your rubbish more complicated than solving a Rubik's cube,\" he will say. \"The public are fed up of all the bin dos and bin don'ts. They just want a simple service.\" The government scheme will make funding available for facilities with technology that sorts waste after it has been picked up, preventing families having to sort rubbish into as many as nine containers. More than half the councils in England collect refuse once a fortnight, although many pick up recycling or food waste on a weekly basis. However, BBC local government correspondent Mike Sergeant said there was no compulsion to bid for a share of the cash. \"Having invested heavily in alternate weekly systems, some may be rather reluctant to go back,\" he said. Mr Benn, the shadow communities secretary, said local people were best-placed to decide how rubbish was collected and should not be dictated to by government. \"At a time of deep cuts, when local councils are having to make very difficult decisions, the quarter of a billion pounds Eric Pickles has found for this could be much better spent on preventing SureStart centres from closing or providing extra care for our elderly people,\" he added. A survey by the Press Association news agency last year found many councils were sticking with fortnightly black bin collections, claiming that a return to weekly rounds would cost millions and undermine recycling efforts. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government says 67% of people surveyed agreed the government should mandate weekly collections. Ministers say more than 70 councils have signalled interest in applying for funding. Bids which support a comprehensive weekly collection of rubbish, combined with a weekly recycling collection of materials such as glass, paper and plastics, will be prioritised. The scheme will support initiatives which reward households for recycling, with points that convert into money off at retailers, such as Windsor and Maidenhead's RecycleBank and Birmingham's Nectar programmes. And it will back mechanical biological treatment plants, already used in Bournemouth, which take all rubbish in just one bin and sort out the materials for recycling, landfill and composting.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Swansea University's Dr Neil Loader and Emeritus Prof Alayne Street-Perrott, are among a team who have found ancient earthworks, possibly 2,000 years old. The discoveries were made in Acre state in the western Brazilian Amazon. Researchers from the universities of Exeter and Reading, and Brazil's S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, Bel\u00c3\u00a9m are also part of the team. Their research investigated ditched enclosures which were concealed for centuries by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation allowed the discovery of more than 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\". The team said the function of these mysterious sites is still little understood. They are unlikely to be villages, since archaeologists have recovered very few artefacts during excavation, and their layout does not suggest they were built for defensive reasons. Instead it is thought they were used only sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America, or Britain's own Stonehenge. Although Dr Loader - who has analysed soil samples from the geoglyphs - said the surroundings in which they were built were very different to other ritual sites around the world. He looked at phytoliths - a type of microscopic plant fossil made of silica - to reconstruct ancient vegetation; charcoal quantities, to assess the amount of ancient forest burning; and carbon stable isotopes, to indicate the type of vegetation growing there in the past. \"The indications are that the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation. So, unlike the towering Maya pyramids of Central America, they were likely not visible above the forest canopy, and this raises questions about their purpose,\" he explained. It had been assumed prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th Century, the Amazonian forests had been pristine ecosystems, free from human influence. But the new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years, which could only have been artificially brought together by humans. It suggested instead of burning large tracts of forest - either for geoglyph construction or agricultural practices - people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms. The team have likened it to a form of \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products. They said there is \"tantalizing evidence\" to suggest the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices to this day.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Humans lived in the Amazon rainforest much earlier than previously thought, and even helped shape its biodiversity, researchers have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

But, within a minute of the restart, the French side led when Richie Myler scored after a flowing move from deep. Liam Watts pounced to touch down to put the Black and Whites ahead again, but Walsh kicked Catalans to victory. With both sides triumphant in their opening matches of the season, the victors were guaranteed to be early pacesetters after two games. However, neither team played like leaders in a dour first period. Catalans edged ahead 4-2 through two Walsh penalties, but the hosts led by four points when Tuimavave touched down following a fine burst by the outstanding Sika Manu. Within 60 seconds of the restart the lead changed again as Australian forward Greg Bird combined with Thomas Bosc to tee up Myler for his second try of the season. Watts then pounced from close range to restore Hull's advantage as the match opened up. But some astute tactical kicking, and the reliable boot of Walsh, steered Dragons to just their second away over Hull in their past 13 attempts. Hull FC coach Lee Radford: \"It was painful to watch.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The former Manchester United striker, best known for his winning goal against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final, arrived with great fanfare in January 2014. He presented a different vision for Cardiff compared with the defensive approach of his predecessor Malky Mackay, renowned for an unspectacular, yet effective style that gained the club promotion to the Premier League in 2013. Mackay's success meant popularity with fans and that probably didn't help Solskjaer's cause. The Scot's bitter falling-out with the club's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan had disillusioned many supporters who saw Mackay's sacking as a regression for a club who had fought so hard for a top-flight return after half a century away. He may have promised a more exciting style, but under Solskjaer the Bluebirds slipped into the Premier League's bottom three for the first time and never recovered, finishing bottom. The results were shocking - 3-0 at Swansea, 6-3 against Liverpool, 3-0 defeats against Crystal Palace and Newcastle and 4-0 losses to Hull and Sunderland. Tan blamed Mackay for relegation, which was confirmed at the penultimate game of the season, and expected a swift Premier League return under the Norwegian. And so began a big recruitment drive in the summer. Nine players came in, many of Mackay's men left, but it seemed even with so many new faces Solskjaer didn't know what his best team was. He named a different starting 11 for all of the games he oversaw this season and his tinkering was deemed to have had an adverse effect on results. Two home defeats in succession, against Norwich and Middlesbrough, sealed his fate. The nature of the capitulation against the Canaries caused particular concern, Cardiff leading 2-0 before conceding four second-half goals to lose 4-2. During the 1-0 loss against Boro four days later, the Cardiff crowd vented their frustration at the Norwegian, booing him as he tried to get the ball to one of his players to take a throw-in. After the game the Norwegian said he accepted the blame for the club's poor run of form. \"I'm responsible and I should get better results than we've had in the first seven games,\" said Solskjaer, who seems to have the ability to remain upbeat in the most trying of circumstances. The manager may be responsible for the team but many feel the board, and particularly owner Vincent Tan, have to take some responsibility too. \"It was the wrong appointment for Cardiff and the wrong club for Solskjaer,\" said former Cardiff captain Jason Perry on BBC Radio Wales. \"Do we know how Cardiff City play? No. \"I think only four players played against Blackburn [in the Championship opener] that played against Middlesbrough. He picked a different back four yet again. \"If you're manager or a coach you have a central strategy and you work on that.\" Solskjaer will not have the chance to find a strategy that works and attention now turns to the next man to work under Tan. Early favourites include Welshman Tony Pulis, who would be popular with fans given the job he did at Crystal Palace last season, and Dundee's Paul Hartley, who has overseen his club's rise to the Scottish Premiership.

{"article": "###\nArticle: This is the full statement to the inquests from his niece, Ms Natalie Tennant, on behalf of his brother, Peter Copoc: Stephen Paul Copoc was born on 1 August 1968, and was aged 20 years when he died at Hillsborough. Stephen was the baby of our family, and the apple of our Mum's eye. Our family consisted of Mum and Dad, I, Peter, my sister Angela and then our Stephen. I was 10 years old when Stephen was born. Angela was just seven years old. Our Dad took us to the hospital, so that we could meet our new baby brother. Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him, and we did. Financially, we had little, but our parents, Agnes and Harold, made sure that there was lots of love in our house. Stephen was such a joy to all of us. Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen's school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons. Profiles of all those who died Stephen's personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him. He was popular with teachers and made friends, having the ability to also keep friends. The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day. When we moved from Garston to our new house in Speke, Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment, getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effortless and  uncomplicated way. I started work at 17. There was a shop in Garston called Smiths that sold everything. It's gone now. I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid. He was about nine at the time and wanted one. As Angela and I were so much older than him, we kind of spoilt him, as he was such a lovable kid. I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it. He was so careful about his toys. When he finished playing with the train set, he would put it away neatly. He minded his toys. He used to follow Angela everywhere, even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him. However, one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt. Angela ran down the cinder path near our home towards the school crying. When she got there, she was told he had not waited for the lollipop lady and got a bump from a car. He was physically fine, but Angela was sobbing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt. Angela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood. All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow. Stephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old. He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their  eggs. It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing. We had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Speke Hall, which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool. He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there. He seldom, if ever, brought fish home to Mum and Dad. It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish, but he preferred to put the fish back into the water. We think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors. He appreciated being outdoors. He finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guilds in Botany and Horticulture. He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature. He applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calderstones Park. He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sudley Hall in Mossley Hill. He loved his work, the people he worked with, he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens. When Stephen was about 15 years old, he met his girlfriend Jackie. They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died. Stephen knew what he wanted from life. He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house. He did not want them living in rented accommodation. He was mature and sensible for his age. He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him, as he wanted our parents to have some money. He was very caring to his nieces and nephews. When Angela's marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children, Sean and Carla, Stephen with his  girlfriend Jackie would babysit and play with the children, keeping them amused for hours. He could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him. Stephen, of course, loved football. His love of football and of Liverpool came from our Dad. The whole family travelled around to watch the matches, but not since 1989. After 1989, we gave the season tickets back and we never went to a football match again. Stephen loved to play football as well. He was not the best of players, but he was like an encyclopaedia when it came to anything about football generally. Stephen was a great music fan. He was always playing Pink Floyd and, in particular, 'Shine on you Crazy Diamond'. He always loved Marillion and went to concerts with his four close friends. Our parents never got over Stephen's death and the way he died. Our brother Stephen was one of life's genuine nice guys. Our Stephen was just 20 years of age, but had maturity and a caring attitude towards others and even from a young age carried a donor card. We miss Stephen from our family and think about what might have been for all of us as a family if Stephen had not died on that awful day.

Pemberton will face between six and 12 years imprisonment. The case has strained ties between the US and the Philippines, a former US colony where the Americans have a significant military presence. The marine was on leave in Olongapo on 11 October 2014, after joint military exercises with the Philippine army, when he met Ms Laude in a bar. Police said they left together and checked into a hotel, where she was found dead the next day, apparently strangled and with her head inside the hotel toilet. Pemberton had previously testified in court that he had attacked Ms Laude after he realised she was transgender, but said she was still alive when he left the room. The prosecution had argued Pemberton should be convicted of murder, but the court downgraded this to homicide. Pemberton was also ordered to pay at least 4.5 million pesos ($95,350; \u00c2\u00a363,140) to Ms Laude's family. Ms Laude's sister, Malou, told Reuters news agency: \"We expected a murder conviction but instead got homicide. We are not content with the decision.\" Pemberton will be temporarily detained in a Philippine jail until the Philippine and US governments agree on where he should be held during his prison term.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Pte Manning, formerly known as Bradley, was sentenced to 35 years in military prison for leaking a massive trove of classified US documents. After the conviction, she announced the desire to live as a woman. However, the US military prohibits transgender people from serving openly in the military. Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, confirmed to the New York Times that Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel had approved a request from the Army to \"evaluate potential treatment options for inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria\". The Associated Press news agency first reported the US military was weighing a potential transfer to civilian prison, citing unnamed Pentagon sources. But on Wednesday, Rear Adm Kirby said no such decision had been been made yet. \"Any such decision will, of course, properly balance the soldier's medical needs with our obligation to ensure Pte Manning remains behind bars,\" he said. A local judge in Leavenworth, Kansas, approved Pte Manning's name change request last month, a move the military did not oppose. Pte Manning has been diagnosed by military doctors multiple times with gender dysphoria, the sense of one's gender being at odds with the sex assigned at birth. But she has requested treatment, including hormone therapy, and the ability to live as a woman. According to a complaint filed by Pte Manning's lawyer, a military doctor at Fort Leavenworth  - where she is being held - had approved a treatment plan by November 2013. But it was delayed as it was sent higher up the chain of command for consideration. The US military is required to treat diagnosed disorders of its soldiers but its policy allows summary dismissal of transgender people. Mr Hagel has said the military policy on transgender soldiers \"continually should be reviewed\". \"Every qualified American who wants to serve our country should have an opportunity if they fit the qualifications and can do it,\" Mr Hagel said on Monday, but he did not say if he believed it should be overturned. Despite this policy, a recent study by a US university estimated there were about 15,000 transgender people serving in the US armed forces. Pte Manning will not be discharged from the military until she finishes her sentence. A judge recently denied a clemency request. Transfers from military prisons to civilian Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities are not unprecedented, but they are usually done after the inmate has been discharged from the military.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The Pentagon is considering transferring Private Chelsea Manning to a civilian prison in order to treat her gender dysphoria, US media report.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Mr Duncan Smith has warned the government risks dividing society with politically-motivated spending cuts. Mr Cameron is to reject this - and No 10 has rubbished claims of a rift with George Osborne, saying the chancellor still has the PM's full confidence. The disability cuts Mr Duncan Smith quit over will be shelved. Downing Street said the changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP) announced ahead of Mr Osborne's Budget last week would not go ahead \"in their current form\". But alternative proposals for saving the \u00c2\u00a34bn earmarked for the savings would not come until the Autumn Statement towards the end of the year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for Mr Osborne's resignation and Conservative MPs have spoken out against the leadership with Mr Duncan Smith's former ministerial team divided in their responses to his resignation. Treasury minister David Gauke is answering an urgent Commons question from Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell on changes to the Budget - Mr McDonnell had called for the chancellor himself but this appears to have been ignored. This will be followed by a statement from Mr Cameron - ostensibly on last week's EU summit - at which he is expected to restate his commitment to \"compassionate Conservatism\" and reject Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of his style of government. Former Tory leader Lord Howard urged MPs to \"listen to what the prime minister has to say\" and to \"calm down\". Mr Duncan Smith set out the reasons for his surprise resignation in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, in which he said the way Mr Osborne had cut benefits in his Budget at the same time as cutting taxes for the better off was \"deeply unfair\" and that he had become \"semi detached\" from government. Ross Hawkins, BBC political correspondent George Osborne: chief tactician and patron, a man whose word makes or wrecks careers. That was the view of many Tory MPs for a very long time. Now, many doubt he will ever be their leader, or even the chancellor much longer. It's not that they think David Cameron is poised to sack him or that he's about to resign, as Labour demand. They simply believe a swift leadership election is highly likely whatever the result of 23 June's EU referendum. If it does come that soon, there will be - one predicts - a \"genocide of the Cameroons and Osbornites\". A stubbornly enduring deficit, a tax credit U-turn, and the sheer numbers of MPs who have chosen to back a leave vote at the referendum have seen Osborne's authority leak. A weekend of melodrama has - in one Tory MP's view - burst the dam. Read more from Ross Lord Howard played down Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of government policy - but Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said they were \"very serious\". \"Today, when David Cameron stands up, he has to reaffirm the message that led many people like myself to join the Conservative Party in the first place when he became leader,\" she said. \"Are we about social justice? Are we about spreading the burden fairly? We need to hear that very clear message today.\" She suggested pensioner benefits - which the Conservatives pledged to protect in their manifesto - should be cut to make up the shortfall. A number of senior Conservative figures have questioned Mr Osborne's credentials to replace David Cameron as prime minister when he steps down. Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell described Mr Osborne's abortive attempt to reform PIP as a \"cock-up\". He said Mr Osborne was \"not the only candidate\" for the party leadership and there were a \"large number\" of alternatives. Influential backbencher David Davis told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire the \u00c2\u00a34bn welfare savings should be cancelled and suggested Mr Osborne should be moved to another department if he wants to be a successful replacement for David Cameron as prime minister. London Mayor Boris Johnson, seen as Mr Osborne's main rival for the top job, is returning from a skiing holiday and has yet to comment. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was understood Mr Cameron had urged Mr Osborne to avoid any major controversy in the Budget so as to avoid fuelling discontent among Tory MPs ahead of the EU referendum. Despite this, our correspondent said, Downing Street insists \"the two men remain as close as ever\", and have dismissed reports that the prime minister will seek to distance himself from Mr Osborne. Number 10 has stressed that PIP will still have to be reformed in the future as the cost is \"unsustainable.\" Mr Corbyn told the BBC Mr Osborne should be \"considering his position\". \"His Budget simply doesn't add up and it unravelled within hours of him presenting it. This isn't the first time a George Osborne Budget has unravelled,\" the Labour leader told BBC1's Breakfast programme. \"It seems to me we need to look at the very heart of this government, at its incompetence, at the way it puts forward proposals that simply don't add up and expects the most needy in our society to take the hit for them.\" Who would the disability changes impact?\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Prime Minister David Cameron will later attempt to halt the civil war in his party caused by Iain Duncan Smith's resignation from the cabinet.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

With his wife and son's help, Chan Jae turned to Instagram, using his account as a storytelling tool to share the pictures he draws by hand for his beloved three grandsons. His account, Drawings for my Grandchildren, now has more than 40,000 followers enchanted by his imaginative creations. Its success isn't entirely by chance. It was the brainchild of his son Ji Lee, a 45-year-old creative director at Facebook, which owns Instagram. The family emigrated to Sao Paulo from Seoul in 1981. But Ji Lee and his wife eventually relocated to New York while his sister and her husband made the decision to return to Korea with their two sons, who were the centre of Chan Jae's world. \"My father was retired and spending time with my nephews, like driving them to school, was a huge part of his day. After they left, he had nothing to do and that scared my mother and me,\" said Mr Lee. \"We were very worried that he would age quickly without having anything to do and would become depressed.\" It took him months to convince his \"quiet reserved\" father who \"hated learning new things\" that he should draw for his grandchildren, as he had for his children, and post the pictures online to stay in touch. \"He hated the idea and just could not grasp the concept. He didn't understand the purpose of why we wanted to share his art on Instagram but I was determined to teach him,\" he told BBC News from his home in New York. \"But I sat down with him every day and at dinner one night, we had a conversation about drawing for my son. That was the turning point and eventually he became more receptive to learn.\" \"Capturing his style of drawing\" was another big struggle he faced. \"Now he uses different editing tools and can even understands hashtags so that was revolutionary.\" \"This Instagram account really changed my father's life. Since then, he's been making one drawing a day. My mother writes the stories and my father brings them to life.\" Dinosaurs, pandas, superheroes and nature are all common themes in Chan Jae's work for his grandchildren. The daily life and culture of Korea also feature prominently. More importantly, each post teaches a lesson, shares a memory or even carries a personal message. They are translated into three languages: English, Korean and Portuguese. \"Your grandma is a super woman. She's carrying a baby in front and another on her back. Children, please don't forget,\" read one heart-warming post. To take things a step further, Ji Lee told his father's story through a video on Facebook which went viral, gathering more than 18,000 reactions and 1.3m views on the site. He said he was shocked by how popular his video had become. \"I went to bed and when I woke up, it had gone viral. The Instagram account has also grown and he now has more than 40,000 followers.\" Thousands of users on Facebook wrote about how Chan Jae's story touched them. \"This is amazing on so many levels. A modern living legacy. Your brilliance has so much depth,\" said Valerie LaMastro. Others like David Harvey shared similar experiences with getting elderly people to make use of technology. \"That's a wonderful story. Beautiful drawings and a beautiful job telling the story, too. My father also had little to no interest in technology until texting and now it has brought us much closer together.\" Devrin Carlson-Smith said: \"I was one of the first to follow 'Drawings for my Grandchildren' and told you the story of how I got my mum into Instagram. I love that your dad is back into his art. I hope to do that too so I don't lose my skills.\" To Ji Lee, the most rewarding part of this all was helping others around the world. \"So many people are sharing my video and interacting with it.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Lewis Hamilton was the fastest of the silver cars, despite a mistake-strewn final lap on a weekend when penalties mean he will start from the back. Team-mate Nico Rosberg, who has a golden opportunity to close the title race deficit, was 0.107secs slower. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was second fastest, followed by Sebastian Vettel. Mercedes have so far not shown their true pace on an unusual weekend that has been dominated by Hamilton's engine penalties - which amount to 55 places following three engine changes, meaning he will start right at the back - and problems with tyre choices caused by the unexpected heat. Spa-Francorchamps is more usually associated with unpredictable and often wet weather, even in August, but this weekend has been baking, with temperatures in the low 30Cs. That means the tyres are suffering - a problem exacerbated by the fact that greater freedom for the teams in tyre choices than previously this year has meant they have leaned towards softer tyres. The super-soft tyre has never been brought to Spa before, because of the demands of its many long, high-speed corners. But Ferrari picked seven sets of the tyre out of their available 13, and only one of the more durable medium. Mercedes have gone the other way, splitting their choices much more evenly between the super-soft, soft and medium. That meant, with only four sets of the super-soft available, Mercedes did not use it at all until the final minutes of the session. It was not immediately clear why Rosberg was 0.768secs off Raikkonen's pace, but Hamilton had a lift in the fast double-left hander at Pouhon and then made mistakes at flat-out Blanchimont and on the entry to the final chicane. Mercedes executive director (technical) Paddy Lowe told BBC Sport that the team were likely to give Hamilton only the least possible running in qualifying - probably meaning only one run in the first session - because of his penalties. \"We'll probably just run the minimum necessary in qualifying,\" Lowe said. \"We want to give Lewis the strongest possible race from the back and with the maximum number of tyres.\" Rosberg, despite his lack of headline pace in the final practice session, is expected to take pole, and there will be a tight battle between Red Bull and Ferrari for best of the rest. Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen, who was fastest on Friday afternoon, did only two laps on Saturday before being hit by a gearbox problem. Hamilton is not the only driver with engine penalties.

{"article": "###\nArticle: That's the conclusion of a study that suggests a fourfold rise in the amount of mineral and organic phosphorus needed on grasslands by 2050. The researchers say that at present, more phosphorus is being lost from soils than is being added by farmers. But there are concerns that increases in the use of the mineral could damage the environment. Phosphorus is an irreplaceable element for all life forms - but it is only since the 19th century that humans have been systematically using it to boost agricultural production. The mineral can be mined as phosphate ore - but animal excrement is also an important source especially in the developing world. Demand grew so rapidly over the 20th century that there were concerns about overuse and \"peak phosphorus\". But research published in 2012, looking at the need for phosphorus on crops, suggested that future demand could be met from existing sources. This new study though looks at the use of phosphorus on grasslands which cover around a quarter of the Earth's ice-free land areas. These fields are crucial are in the production of milk and meat. As global incomes rise, demand for these products is set to soar. This in turn will spark a rise in demand grass crops and production is expected to increase by 80% by 2050. But the study points out that at present, the vast majority of grasslands in the world are losing more phosphorus than they are gaining. The losses are mainly caused by farmers collecting manure from grasslands and using it to fertilise croplands. The amount being lost from intensive farming is far greater than from pastoral systems. Between 1970 and 2005, 44% of these losses occurred in Asia. \"This is one main factor,\" said Prof Martin van Ittersum, a co-author of the study from the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands. \"Of all the manure that is deposited on the grassland, half of it is taken away for croplands or used for fuel or for plastering the walls of the houses in Africa.  The fact is that the grasslands are not fertilised, so you have very little inputs to the system.\" The researchers say that to meet the projected demand for grassland in 2050, the amounts of phosphorus used will have to grow more than fourfold from 2005 levels. To cope with both grassland and arable land demands, the overall use of mineral phosphorus fertiliser must double by the middle of the century. \"It is a vast area but that is very significant, yes,\" said Prof van Ittersum. \"It is our strong assumption, that productivity will decrease and the pressure on our feed crops will increase and that is something that we should avoid,\" he said. \"There is already a societal concern that we are feeding too much of our cereal crops to livestock and that pressure will only increase if our grasslands decrease in productivity.\" But increasing the amount of phosphorus used on land, especially in mineral form, carries significant environmental concerns. Excessive use of fertilisers of all types can lead to a leaching of nutrients into the sea where they have created so-called \"dead zones\". \"A fourfold rise in phosphorus use would have a big impact on the environment, especially on marine life,\" said Marissa de Boer who is European Project Manager of SusPhos at VU University in Amsterdam. \"The leaching of phosphorus from agricultural lands into rivers and eventually the sea leads to uncontrolled algae growth and dead zones such as the ones found in the Baltic Sea, Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico. This is an effect of increased fertilizer use in the past half century. What would the effect be if we now increase phosphorus use fourfold?\" Prof van Ittersum says these issues can be controlled. The most important thing is awareness. \"We are still talking about modest amounts, I don't think the environmental risks are particularly big,\" he told BBC News. \"We have to do it carefully, we have to reuse our residues and wastes and make sure as little phosphorus as possible ends up in our sewage systems.\" The study has been published in the journal, Nature Communications.

Hurt by failing oil prices, Canada's ailing economy has become a major issue as the country elects new leadership. Mr Harper said that about 15% of condos in Vancouver aren't being lived in. \"If such foreign, non-resident buyers are artificially driving up the cost of real estate and Canadian families are shut out of the market, that is a matter we can and should do something about,\" said Mr Harper said, who was campaigning in Vancouver on Wednesday.

The average price of a detached home in Vancouver - the country's most expensive market - is more than $1 million (\u00c2\u00a3640,000). Harper's Conservative Party said it was looking into restrictions on foreign homeownership that have been put in place by other western countries.

You just want to have that extra goal to go in 2-0 possibly at half-time based on how well we'd played. \"Second half, you knew there was going to be a reaction and they changed their system and had a go at us so it's a bit frustrating that we've not won the game, but the way the second half went at times I'm delighted we got another point.\" Match ends, Nottingham Forest 1, Preston North End 1.

Mr Vallenilla says he once worked with the president on Caracas' transport system, and called on his \"former colleague\" to clear his son's name. The president has said firearms must not be used on protesters. \"I want to speak to my former colleague of the Caracas Metro,\" Mr Vallenilla told a group of reporters outside the morgue. \"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, you know that we worked together, I'm Supervisor Vallenilla.\" He said he used to be Mr Maduro's boss, although the past working relationship between them has not yet been confirmed. President Maduro is a former bus driver, who got involved in trade unions and then national politics, becoming president in 2013 after his predecessor Hugo Chavez died. \"Please, Nicol\u00e1s, my friend,\" Mr Vallenilla said with tears streaming down his face, before calling on the leader to make it clear that his only son \"was not a criminal, he was a graduating student\". \"You met him when he was little,\" he added. Earlier in the week, Fabi\u00e1n Urbina, 17, was also shot and killed as security forces and demonstrators clashed in Caracas. There have been almost daily anti-government protests in Venezuela for over two months as the country's economic and political crisis has worsened. More than 70 people have been killed in protest-related violence since 1 April, according to figures released by the chief prosecutor's office. On Thursday, Interior Minister N\u00e9stor Reverol tweeted to confirm the death of a protester and said a police sergeant had fired an \"unauthorised weapon\". President Maduro, in a press conference on the same day, said: \"I am giving the clear order that you can not use firearms. I am giving the clear order that you can never shoot in a demonstration, under any conditions.\" A group of demonstrators returned on Friday to the place where Mr Vallenilla was killed, and set some trucks on fire. Also on Friday, supporters of jailed opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez released footage that they say captures his cries from a military prison on the outskirts of Caracas. \"Lilian!\" he calls to his wife. \"They are torturing me!\" In a press conference earlier the same day, Lilian Tintori said she has not been able to see him for 19 days and his lawyers have been denied access for 78 days. News site Ultimas Noticias has responded by publishing photos of the politician, which they say are from Friday and show him to be \"fine\".

Boston College has been issued with a subpoena instructing it to hand over the material on 6 May. Mr McIntyre said he had engaged a lawyer to \"resist the efforts to raid his personal memoirs\". Dozens of loyalists and republicans provided testimonies to Boston College staff compiling an oral history of the Northern Ireland conflict. What are the 'Boston tapes'? Dozens of former paramilitaries were interviewed in Belfast and other cities and towns from 2001-2006 as part of an oral history project known as the Belfast Project. Details about internal politics and activities of the IRA were revealed on tape, including accounts of a hunger strike in prison in the 1980s. Overall, the project cost about $200,000 (\u00c2\u00a3118,520), mostly provided by an Irish-American businessman. Each interview was transcribed, sent by encrypted email to New York and then the material was sent to Boston College, where it was placed under lock and key at Burns Library. Following a lengthy legal battle with the college, the Police Service of Northern Ireland gained access to a small number of the interviews in 2013. Interviews were given on the understanding that tapes would not be made public until after their deaths. Detectives want to access the recordings as part of their investigations into murder and other paramilitary crimes from the 1970s to 1990s. In June last year, police were given access to interviews given by former loyalist prisoner Winston Rea. It followed a decision by senior judges in Belfast to lift an injunction on the PSNI taking possession of Mr Rea's recorded account to Boston College researchers. In 2013, detectives investigating the abduction and murder of Belfast mother-of-10 Jean McConville in 1972 secured the transcripts of former IRA woman Dolours Price's account.

Some of the birds at the undisclosed premises in Lincolnshire have died. The rest are due to be culled. Defra said an investigation was \"under way to determine the source of the infection\". A 1.8-mile (3km) protection zone and a six-mile (10km) surveillance area have been set up around the turkey rearing farm to reduce the risk of the disease spreading. An outbreak of the virus in a flock of about 6,000 turkeys at Low Farm, in Fulstow, near Louth, was \"unlikely to be directly linked to the previous case\" at the nearby Austen Fen Farm, Defra had said. All restrictions were removed around Austen Fen Farm on 18 January but still remain at Low Farm while an inquiry there continues.

Under the deal, any returns would be voluntary and only \"when conditions were conducive\". Cameroon has rejected the accusation and said people returned willingly. According to the UNHCR, more than 2,600 refugees have been forcibly returned to Nigeria from Cameroon this year. Many are unable to go back to their villages in Borno state for security reasons and have ended up in camps for displaced people. In some cases, the UNHCR said, people had been returned \"without allowing them time to collect their belongings\". UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch spoke of \"chaos\" in the returns process and said \"some women were forced to leave their young children behind in Cameroon, including a child less than three years old\". Many of the returnees are now settled in the Banki camp for internally displaced people. UNHCR staff also recorded about 17 people who claimed to be Cameroonian nationals, who it said had been deported by mistake to Banki. It is common in the region to find people who have no documentary proof of their nationality. Cameroonian Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme: \"I strongly deny this accusation\" of forced returns. He said the Cameroonian army had been working \"hand-in-hand\" with the Nigerian army against Boko Haram and any civilians who had returned to Nigeria had done so of their own accord. \"This repatriation has taken place willingly,\" he said. The Cameroonian authorities have previously said Boko Haram militants have been entering the country disguised as refugees. Militants have carried out a number of attacks in northern Cameroon in recent years, often using suicide bombers. The UNHCR said forced return constitutes a serious violation of the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1969 OAU Convention, both of which Cameroon has ratified.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Annie Woodland, 24, who lived in Essex, suffered brain damage in the incident at Gloucester Park Pool in Basildon. A teacher and a pool life guard both failed to realise she was in trouble. The family has successfully sued Essex County Council who said it did not comment on individual cases but had noted the High Court judgement. The tragedy happened in July 2000 when Ms Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Primary School in Basildon. At an earlier hearing, judges ruled a victory against the county council would risk a \"chilling effect\" on the willingness of schools to take pupils on educational trips. A Supreme Court judgement in 2013 overturned this ruling and opened the way for a High Court hearing. Mr Justice Blake has now ruled lifeguard Debbie Maxwell and swimming teacher Paula Burlinson should have noticed Ms Woodland was drowning sooner than they did. He concluded Essex County Council was liable for their negligence although neither woman was employed directly by the council. Ms Burlinson's failure to notice Annie in distress \"fell far below the standard of care reasonably to be expected of a teacher\", he said. Ms Maxwell was also negligent as \"she was not paying sufficient attention to users in the water\". The amount of compensation to Ms Woodland, who now lives in Blackpool, will be assessed at a later date.

{"article": "###\nArticle: New analysis for BBC News shows that many people relying on their savings income are worse off than ever before. Savings rates plummeted after the Bank of England slashed its base rate in the financial crisis. Since last autumn, as the economic outlook has worsened, they have fallen again. Tax-free Isas, fixed rate bonds and easy access accounts are all at or near their lowest points. In research carried out for the BBC, the rate-checking firm Savings Champion recorded 1,440 savings rate cuts last year and more than 230 so far this year. While low interest rates are welcomed by mortgage borrowers, they strike fear into those at or near retirement who had hoped that income from their nest eggs would help pay the bills. \"There's no light at the end of the tunnel,\" says 76-year-old Mick Bridge, one of a group of ramblers from Chesterfield who all depend on savings. \"Like most retired people, there was a plan and suddenly it's not like it was anymore. The pot's disappearing.\" Fellow walker Sharon Beresford is worried that low interest rates will leave more older people needing help to pay for care. \"It's helping young people buy houses, but it's not helping me,\" she says, \"There are a lot of us to be looked after.\" The fall in rates has come across the board, with significant reductions from National Savings & Investments, Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Nationwide Building Society. The average return from the five best easy access accounts has dropped from more than 3% in 2012 to under 1.3%. Tax-free Isa rates are at their lowest ever. The average variable rate Isa is down to 1%, while a typical fixed-rate Isa pays 1.4%. Another Chesterfield rambler, 63-year-old Judith Knowles, started dipping into her savings when she discovered she would have to wait for her state pension because women's pension ages were being raised. Low savings rates have forced her to dip in again. \"It's worrying,\" she says. \"I've had letters saying the rates are going down even more.\" Some rates of return are so tiny that savers can improve their situation by switching to a better offer. First Direct pays just 0.05% to customers in its Savings Account, while Santander has an Easy Isa with an interest rate of a mere 0.1%. Anna Bowes, director of Savings Champion, traces the problem back to a decision by the previous Coalition government to supply banks with cheap money to boost their lending. \"The competition between providers has been sucked out of the market,\" she explains, \"They just don't need to raise money from savers any more, which has had a devastating impact.\" A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: \"These have been frustrating times for savers. The Bank of England's base rate has remained at a record low for several years. \"While this has been good news for borrowers, it has fostered a low-interest-rate environment which has not been easy for many savers to bear.\" The looming EU referendum has confused the outlook for savers, with George Osborne warning borrowers that a vote to leave could lead to higher interest rates and others speculating that uncertainty could prompt the Bank of England to cut its base rate again. Behind the scenes, senior bankers warn that very low savings rates are likely to be the \"new normal\", given the precarious economic situation across the world.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Interest rates for savers have fallen to new record lows, after hundreds of cuts in recent months and more than 1,000 in the past year.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The decision was announced at a meeting in the German city of Bonn after the UN's cultural committee spent more than a year considering its nomination. World heritage status is given to sites of \"outstanding universal value\" with the aim of protecting them for future generations. The distinctive red bridge has carried trains over the Forth since 1890. Scotland's other World Heritage Sites are New Lanark, St Kilda, the Old and New Towns in Edinburgh, Neolithic Orkney and the Antonine Wall. The award puts it alongside the Pyramids of Egypt, the great Wall of China and the Sydney Opera House in terms of cultural significance. The bridge, which spans the Firth of Forth between South Queensferry on the outskirts of Edinburgh and North Queensferry in Fife, was opened in 1890 after eight years of construction. Designed by Sir John Fowler and Benjamin Baker, it measures 2,529m (1.5 miles), weighs 53,000 tonnes and was at the time the world's longest multi-span cantilever bridge. When it was constructed it was one of the most ambitious projects of its kind ever attempted, and at its peak, more than 4,500 men were employed building it. The Unesco inspection report stated: \"This enormous structure, with its distinctive industrial aesthetic and striking red colour, was conceived and built using advanced civil engineering design principles and construction methods. \"Innovative in design, materials and scale, the Forth Bridge is an extraordinary and impressive milestone in bridge design and construction during the period when railways came to dominate long-distance land travel.\" For 125 years it has been an icon of Victorian engineering excellence, a symbol of Scotland and even a favourite expression for a never-ending task. Now the Forth Bridge is listed alongside the Pyramids of Egypt, the great Wall of China and the Sydney Opera House in terms of cultural significance. We've brought together some facts and figures - and more great pictures - of one of Britain's best-known structures, which you can see here. The bid for World Heritage status was led by the Forth Bridges Forum, which was established by the Scottish government to promote the three Forth Bridges. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the bridge was one of the \"industrial wonders of the world\" and congratulated the team behind the bid. She added: \"The Forth Bridge is an outstanding example of Scotland's built heritage. \"Its endurance is testament not only to the ingenuity of those who designed and built it but also to the generations of painters, engineers and maintenance crews who have looked after it through the years.\" The bridge is owned by Network Rail, whose infrastructure director, David Dickson, described it as \"a prime example of civil engineering and an iconic structure, not only in Scotland but across the world.\" Mike Cantlay, chairman ofTourism agency VisitScotland said World Heritage Site status would lends \"even greater aura and appeal to one of the planet's most instantly recognisable landmarks\". He added: \"The timing is perfect as, in 2016, this country will celebrate the Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design and you would be hard-pushed to find a better example of all three qualities anywhere in the world than in the Forth Bridge.\" UK Heritage Minister Tracey Crouch said: \"Recognition as a World Heritage Site will draw more tourists to the area as well as making sure one of the UK's great engineering feats stands for future generations.\" There are now more than 1,000 World Heritage Sites across the globe, in 161 countries.

{"article": "###\nArticle: That's hardly a surprise. These things are never made public. Removing Strachan and his coaches and finding replacements would have meant a serious hit to the coffers of an association that has routinely failed to benefit from the millions of euros on offer to those nations who qualify for major championships. Money was not brought up in the statement, but it's inconceivable that it didn't play a part in the discussion. Why pay when the World Cup campaign is already on life support? Why not accept your fate of another doomed mission, let him see out of his deal, save the cash and make a change if one needs to be made when the group fixtures are completed? The SFA couldn't say any of this. It couldn't say it was unwilling, or unable, to pay off the manager, so a different narrative was delivered in its statement, a narrative of \"jam tomorrow\". In this optimistic view of the world, all that was missing was a complimentary pair of pom-poms. All hope of a play-off spot for the World Cup is not lost, they say. They're clinging to the belief that Scotland can garner enough points from a remaining available total of 18 to force their way into the reckoning when the evidence of everybody's eyes tell us otherwise. Presenting a scenario of Scotland reeling off win after win required a fair amount of chutzpah for an association that has watched its team concede seven goals in three winless games. And that on top of two years without a competitive win against anybody other than Malta and Gibraltar. Stewart Regan, the SFA's chief executive, is quoted on how adamant Strachan is about his team's capacity to make up ground in the group. How? He doesn't say. Regan points out that the board is convinced that Strachan still has the \"hunger for the challenge\". Hunger shouldn't have anything to do with it when you've failed to qualify for the most easily accessible Euros in history and then sit fifth out of six in a World Cup qualification group with your dreams going up in a puff of smoke. Scotland will limp on now until March, when they host Slovenia at Hampden. Will we hear again that Slovenia is not a must-win? Will we see anything different? Will any new players be considered? Will there be any thoughts about a new formation? Is there likely to be any acknowledgement that, if Scotland keep doing the same things, they are going to end up with the same results? There was no hint of that in Strachan's words in the SFA statement on Thursday. No acceptance that, if he's staying on, he needs to have a major think about what he is doing, who's he selecting and not selecting. If he had spoken about a new beginning then you might - might - be inclined to buy into it. Is he even thinking about it that way? You would hope so, but it's unlikely. There is so much to ponder. Does Scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1? Can a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder? Maybe not, but where are the ideas? We saw a snapshot of Strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played Ikechi Anya at right-back at Wembley. What happens when Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson are both fit at left-back, along with Lee Wallace and Stephen Kingsley? Is it really one from four there? Does it have to be that way? Where's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different? And what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene? Aberdeen's Graeme Shinnie, Fulham's Tom Cairney, Brighton's Jamie Murphy, Aston Villa's Ross McCormack, Stoke City's Phil Bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, Middlesbrough's Jordan Rhodes. There are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly. Too often, Strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team. The tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that Scotland become truly competitive, like Northern Ireland. They have decent Premier League centre-halves - from West Brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from Southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth. And yet, from a squad largely made up of Championship, League One and Scottish Premiership players, Northern Ireland get the kind of results that are beyond Scotland. The attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism. It's tantamount to a white flag being raised. A quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what Michael O'Neill is doing with his meagre resources in Belfast. The SFA's statement on Thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of Hampden. When they can't get a draw against Georgia, can't beat Lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like Slovakia, the idea of Scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell. Scotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "In the Scottish Football Association's statement of Thursday evening, there is no mention of money and the kind of cash it would have taken to bring to an end the reign of Gordon Strachan as national team manager.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Dubbed \"carbon farming\", researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices. The research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics. Jatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts. It is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil. In this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert. \"The results are overwhelming,\" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart. \"There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,\" he said. According to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period. The scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas. They are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good,  short term solution to climate change. \"I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.\" According to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS). A number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially. Growing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return. \"Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,\" said Prof Becker. But other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions. Lucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different. \"When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,\" she said. \"But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal.\" She pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea. \"It is still somebody else's land. Why go in and grow these massive plantations to deal with a problem these people didn't actually cause?\" Follow Matt on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Scientists say that planting large numbers of jatropha trees in desert areas could be an effective way of curbing emissions of CO2.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He was killed by soldiers in a hail of bullets shortly before a meeting of his cabinet in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou. Mr Sankara's assassination led to his second-in-command, Blaise Compaore, seizing power in a coup.

Burkina Faso opened an investigation into the killing after he was ousted from power in 2014. Speaking at a press conference in Ouagadougou, the family lawyer, Benewende Stanislas Sankara, said an investigating judge had formally asked French authorities to declassify military documents to see whether France had played a role in the assassination. A request had also been made to interview French officials who were involved in Burkina Faso's affairs at the time, the lawyer added. Burkina Faso issued an arrest warrant for Mr Compaore in 2015, accusing him of involvement in Mr Sankara's killing.

I know how good a player Goffin is. You don't get to be ranked 15 in the world in today's game, with the depth that there is, if you're not pretty good.\" The weight of evidence makes Murray a strong favourite to complete the job on Sunday, and add the Davis Cup to the game's great prizes he has already won at Wimbledon, the US Open and Olympic Games. Murray, 28, has won both previous matches against Goffin in straight sets, at Wimbledon in 2014 and the Paris Masters earlier this month - that one a 6-1 6-0 drubbing. This third encounter will take place on the indoor clay of Flanders Expo, and with 90% of the crowd willing the Scot to lose. \"I'm sure there will be nerves there, but I like being nervous,\" said Murray. \"I think it helps me. It helps me concentrate. It helps me give a little bit more effort. It might only be a couple of percent, but it all makes a difference.\" Goffin, 24, has risen from outside the top 100 just 16 months ago to 16 in the world. He unexpectedly needed five sets to see off Edmund on Friday and then played four sets of doubles on Saturday, but insisted \"physically, I'm feeling good\". Goffin added: \"I've never played against Andy on a clay court, so I'm going to try to play my best tennis. \"Of course, I have nothing to lose. They lead 2-1 in the tie. I just have to give everything I have for the match. I think on a clay court I have some weapons to play a good match.\" Smith is within sight of guiding Britain to an historic Davis Cup victory, but remains focused on the task at hand. Ward and Edmund were out practising on court soon after the doubles ended on Saturday, and their captain said: \"There's so much to be played - potentially two big matches. \"But I would rather be having two shots rather than one.\" There is a very real possibility that Ward, who won a five-set thriller over American John Isner in the first round, would be called up for a deciding rubber. Van Herck has a similar dilemma, but Darcis declared himself available and the captain roused his players to make one last effort. \"There's a huge task ahead of us,\" he said. \"I think for every tennis player, it's a position he wants to be in. \"We're going to show that we're a strong group, we're a strong team, and we're going to try to solve this together. We're all going to be ready to fight again.

Joshua, 27, says his 13 weeks of preparation have been \"tougher times than I have had in any walk of life\". Klitschko, 41, lost his heavyweight title to Tyson Fury in November 2015 - his first defeat in 11 years. In an interview at his Sheffield training camp before the biggest fight of his career, Joshua spoke about his motivation, being a \"man of the people\", the state of British boxing, and his family. Joshua, unbeaten in 18 fights since turning professional in 2013, said he is not worried about his safety in the ring because of the intensity of his training before the fight. \"I've been pushed to places I've never been pushed before,\" said the Briton. \"I think I take more punishment in the gym than I do in the fights. Sometimes I try things and it doesn't work and I've broken my ribs, my hand, dislocated shoulders in the gym but we get it right for the fight. \"One of the main things is his mindset at the minute. He claims he is obsessed and I ask 'What is he obsessed about?' I look at myself in the mirror and it is about beating me. \"I've lived simple. I've been training under the dark light so I can shine under the bright lights on April 29.\" Joshua had numerous incidents with the police as a youth, including being arrested for ABH, drug possession and being electronically tagged. He has previously stated that he would have been in jail were it not for boxing. But Joshua said: \"I've had tougher times in the gym than I have had in any walk of life at the minute. \"I put myself through it and it is important to because I don't want to be star of the gym and then when I get to the fight it's like: 'I've never faced this type of warrior before.'\" Asked if this is the defining fight of his career, Joshua replied: \"It is one of them. If this was towards the end of my career, I would say: 'This is the defining fight that's going to write the history books.' \"But I've still got so many more years. I'm confident. I'm learning about myself, so this fight is, for me, one fight that I've got to take in my stride round by round and when I take that attitude the victory comes and we move on and there are so many other big fights in the UK.\" Joshua does not believe Klitschko has underestimated him, saying: \"He's coming game, he's coming ready, and the body does what the mind tells it. His mind seems to be in the right place so I'm in for a tough fight.\" \"I may not express myself flashing what I've done and telling everyone I'm the greatest,\" he said. \"Where we grew up, everyone was about making money, but low key, understated - you probably didn't want to get your house burgled! \"Who I am when I was 17 is who I am today, so not much has changed. \"You've got to add a bit of flavour. It's needed now and again, but it's got to be real because I don't take boxing as an act. This is way of expressing myself and being true to myself and there are kids watching so you've got to be mindful. \"If I was to be that type of person - loud and trashing tables - after a fight, I would still continue to be that way. What I notice about fighters is they act a certain way and once the fight has started they are hugging each other and are quiet. \"I'm just trying to be myself on camera, in the ring, outside of the ring and off camera.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Asked about being very accessible, Joshua says: \"It's part of boxing. It is good to lock yourself away but I'm a man of the people, it's no bother. As long as it doesn't make me late for training, I've no problem speaking to 100 people. \"I'm in the same flat that I've been in since 2011 - it's been a long time. I think I'll be one of those guys who will learn the piano, the violin, bungee jump and do all the things I didn't do when I was fighting. \"When I'm not fighting, I try to take a holiday and experience things, but when I'm fighting the simple life has worked and I don't try and change it.\" \"I was on the complete opposite end of healthy living before boxing, it's got me strong,\" he said. \"I'm a superhero to my little cousins. It's what it does for my family and my surname Joshua. \"People are proud to wear that name and I'm representing my family. It is nice to have kids supporting you. It's reaching out to a wider audience. \"I'm just a normal person. You have your good days, your bad days, you have road rage, everyone goes through it. \"You've just got to live by the job you do and if that's what comes with it I'd rather choose winning over anything.\" Joshua, who turned professional after winning gold at London 2012, said: \"When I first turned professional, no-one would touch me sponsorship-wise and no-one was really backing boxing. \"I say look at the characters of the sport, look at the individuals, get behind the gloves.\" He praised fellow Brits Tyson Fury, who won the heavyweight title with a win over Klitschko in November 2015, Dillian Whyte, the WBC International heavyweight title holder, former British and Commonwealth heavyweight title holder David Price and Dereck Chisora, who challenged for the WBC heavyweight title in 2012. \"As I've been in the game, Fury won, Dillian, myself, Chisora the likes of Price, up-and-coming heavyweights and lighter weights - it's definitely brought more attention.\" Asked if he was worried about his mum watching his fights, Joshua answers: \"No, no, no, definitely not. Because she's proud, she's happy and I look after her so I think that's the main thing. \"I've got a son and I definitely wouldn't want him to fight because of those reasons, his health, it's tough. \"I did it quietly. When I first started fighting, I didn't tell my family. It was just about me and what I wanted to do. \"My mum has always seen the positive light of fighting rather than the health issues and I've always been on the road to winning and glory. \"She's had a few tough times and a few scares when I've lost as an amateur, but we bounce back, and for all the good times she's forgot about the bad times we've had.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Anthony Joshua says he will be competing at a \"whole new level\" when he takes on Wladimir Klitschko in Saturday's world title bout.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Judge William Sylvester has denied a request by Denver-area media for expanded coverage on 30 July. The suspect's lawyers had objected to the media's request. His first court appearance on Monday was filmed, despite the defence team's objections. He appeared dazed as he sat in court in a burgundy jail suit with dyed orange hair, prompting media speculation about his mental state. According to a report on ABC News , the suspect has been forced to wear a face guard because he kept spitting at prison officers. Judge Sylvester's order on Tuesday follows calls from some victims' family members to avoid using the suspect's name and his photos. \"I don't want the media to be saturated with the shooter's name,\" said Jordan Ghawi, whose 24-year-old sister Jessica was killed in the shooting. Police were not allowing residents of Mr Holmes' apartment building to return on Tuesday, as investigators continued to work there. Officials reportedly found 30 grenades and several gallons of gasoline inside the apartment, rigged into a booby-trap. Twenty of the wounded remained in hospital on Tuesday, including six in critical condition. Batman star Christian Bale visited victims at the Medical Center of Aurora in the afternoon, the hospital's president confirmed. \"It was good for the patients,\" Bill Voloch told the Denver Post. \"We hope it was therapeutic for them, and all the staff really appreciated him coming.\" Mr Voloch said that the actor had asked to visit, but requested that the media not be notified. A Facebook photo of Bale at the hospital was posted online. The BBC's Alastair Leithead says the actor also met paramedics, doctors and police officers involved in treating people in the aftermath, as well as visited a makeshift memorial to the dead. Meanwhile, a heavily pregnant 21-year-old woman who escaped the cinema shootings gave birth to a baby boy on Tuesday morning. Katie Medley's husband Caleb, a 23-year-old aspiring comedian, was shot in the head and remains in a critical condition. A small group of Democratic lawmakers in Washington renewed calls on Tuesday to ban high-capacity gun magazines. But with November's elections looming, congressional leaders and President Barack Obama said there would be no movement on gun control in the near future. Senator Robert Menendez, among the few calling for tougher laws, conceded calls for legislation were unlikely to succeed, but said it was important to start a debate. \"I hope that this does spark a national conversation about where we go in terms of reasonable gun control measures,\" Sen Menendez said.

Former Scotland striker Steven Thompson gives his marks out of 10 for the display. No chance with goals but had little else to do other than pick the ball out of his net. A surprise choice but the Derby winger defended well considering he wasn't in his natural position. Scotland's best player on the night after a long absence from the international scene.

The Celtic captain gave the midfield energy and aggression as expected. Largely ineffectual. Didn't get on the ball enough to make a positive impact.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Satellite images show colonies moving their locations in years when the thin sea ice on which they habitually breed forms late or is absent. Scientists report the observations in the online journal Plos One. They reveal the birds travelling long distances to find alternative sites. These are further in towards the coast, up on the ice shelves - the thick slabs of glacier ice that jut out over the ocean. It is a surprise because these shelves are frequently faced with cliffs that may be tens of metres high in places. But somehow, the emperors find a way up to breed, and also to come and go as they forage for the seafood that will sustain their chicks. \"We thought that in years when the sea ice was bad, they just didn't breed, but they're clearly more adaptable than that,\" said lead author Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey. The emperor is the most southerly of the Antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter. Their reliance on these thin seasonal marine floes as a reproductive platform, coupled with concern about how the patterns of Antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world, has led to the species being designated as \"near threatened\" on the IUCN red list. Currently, the extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year, albeit slowly. The coverage does however vary considerably by region, and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century. But this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead. In the observations of Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, for example, the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow them to get past a 30m-high cliff. \"When they go out from the colony to forage, they go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea. We're not sure how they get down - they may slide down or jump down,\" Mr Fretwell told BBC News. \"But this cliff is too steep for them to climb back up and so they must return a different way, likely through an ice creek. This route is 5km longer and we know they take it because we can see their tracks in the satellite pictures.\" There is a big opportunity here to go study these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition. There is obviously some cost to going up on the ice shelves - they are windier and the birds must travel further to forage. If that cost was not there, they would habitually breed on the shelves rather than the temperamental thin floes.  But how big this cost is and how beneficial is the observed adaptation in years of poor sea ice has yet to be properly established. Co-author Barbara Wienecke from the Australian Antarctic Division said: \"These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals. However, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations. \"The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected. \"We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Emperor penguins have displayed some unexpected breeding behaviour in the Antarctic that could mean they are much more resilient to environmental change than previously recognised.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) has placed male bear Arktos in with female Victoria at its Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore. Polar bear cubs were last born in the UK almost 25 years ago. Arktos is one of two male bears at the park at Kincraig in the Cairngorms National Park. The pair could remain together for about two weeks. Arktos will eventually return to an enclosure he shares with the other male, Walker. RZSS said captive breeding was an important part of a wider effort to conserve polar bears, which are classified as \"vulnerable\" on the International Union Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. However, animal welfare organisations OneKind Scotland and Born Free Foundation have said tackling climate change to better protect wild bears should be the focus of conservation efforts rather than captive breeding. RZSS, which also manages Edinburgh Zoo where efforts have been made to breed giant pandas, said Arktos and Victoria have mated several times so far. The society said the pair would live together for the next week or two \"mimicking what would occur naturally in the wild\". Vickie Larkin, head carnivore keeper at the park, said the pair had appeared to have bonded well since being introduced. She said: \"Both polar bears have really warmed to each other and all the signs are really positive. \"From the first moment they met, Arktos has been really gentle with Victoria and their bond has been immediate. \"Polar bear breeding is inherently complex as the species are induced ovulators, meaning that the female only releases an egg after initial mating occurs. They also practice delayed implantation, where the egg doesn't implant into the uterine wall until some months later.\" Ms Larkin added: \"If successful, Victoria will not fall pregnant until August to September time. \"Other key stages are her entering the birthing den in October to November and potentially giving birth in December to January. Any cubs would then not come out of the birthing den until March to April 2017.\" Arktos arrived at the park in April 2012 from a zoo in Hannover, Germany. When being given health checks, park staff talk to Arktos in German, the language he heard when he was in the zoo in Hannover.

{"article": "###\nArticle: He was driven to Pretoria's Kgosi Mampuru prison where he is expected to be housed in the hospital wing. Judge Thokozile Masipa gave Pistorius a five-year jail sentence for culpable homicide, but cleared him of murder. His defence said it expected him to serve about 10 months, with the remainder under house arrest. His family say he will not appeal. The parents of Reeva Steenkamp told the BBC they were happy with the sentence and relieved the case was over. Prosecutors had called for a minimum 10-year term, and the defence had argued for community service and house arrest. Pistorius, 27, an amputee sprinter who became the first athlete to compete in the Olympic and Paralympic Games, killed Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. He says he shot her by mistake, fearing there was an intruder in his house in Pretoria. Ms Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, reality TV star and law graduate, was hit three times by bullets fired by Pistorius through a toilet door. Before he went down the stairs and out of court, Oscar Pistorius slipped off his expensive watch and handed it to a relative. It seems the athlete probably knew his sentence beforehand, which helps explains the subdued atmosphere in court today. This case has revealed plenty about South Africa - its gun culture, the strengths and inadequacies of its police and prisons. But above all it has been a simple story, about the rise and fall of a global icon. As the crowds and cameras drift away from the courthouse, what lingers is the sense of waste. Of lives and careers for sure. But of time too. A man and a woman went into a bathroom. Only one came out alive. As the judge made clear - the trial should have been over in a matter of weeks. Instead it turned into a tortuous, overwrought epic. Relief as justice is served Pistorius showed little reaction to the sentence other than to wipe his eyes before being led away to a holding cell downstairs. He was then driven away from court in an armoured police van to Pretoria's Kgosi Mampuru prison, where he was expected to undergo a medical assessment. It is likely that he will be held in a one-man cell in the hospital wing, thought to be most appropriate for the athlete's disability. Correctional services spokesman Manelisi Wolela told AFP news agency Pistorius was \"already accommodated at Kgosi Mampuru\". He could be released after serving a sixth of his sentence, or 10 months, for good behaviour. However, Dup De Bruyn, a lawyer for the Steenkamp family, told Reuters that he believed Pistorius would probably serve two years. Pistorius's uncle, Arnold, said the family would not appeal against the sentence. \"We accept the judgment. Oscar will embrace the opportunity to pay back to society,\" he said. He appealed to the media to \"accept the ruling of court and let us move forward in this process and give us some degree of dignity and privacy\". The BBC's Nomsa Maseko, outside court, says opinion there was divided on the sentence, with some saying it was too light, others that it was fair. Judge Masipa said she considered her sentence \"fair and just, both to society and to the accused\". She said: \"A non-custodial sentence would send the wrong message to the community. On the other hand, a long sentence would also not be appropriate either, as it would lack the element of mercy.\" She said Pistorius had made an \"enormous contribution to society\", in his charity work and in changing the public perception of disability. But she added: \"It would be a sad day for this country if an impression were to be created that there was one law for the poor and disadvantaged, and another for the rich and famous.\" Judge Masipa also gave Pistorius a three-year suspended sentence for a separate incident - firing a gun in a restaurant. The prosecution service said it would consider an appeal but expressed satisfaction that Pistorius had been given jail time. However, the Women's League of South Africa's ruling African National Congress said it did plan to appeal. \"We're doing this not only for Reeva but for the millions of South African women who are killed at the hands of their partners, people who are supposed to protect them,\" said spokeswoman Khsuela Sangoni. \"A five-year sentence like this sends a message to society that it is fine to commit such heinous crimes as femicide, and you will be able to get away with a slap on the wrist.\" The International Paralympic Committee told the BBC it would not allow Pistorius to run at any of its events for five years, even if he were released early. Inside Oscar Pistorius's home 1 2 3 5 4 Mr Pistorius said he and Ms Steenkamp had dinner at about 19:00 before going to bed at 21:00. He said he woke in the early hours, spoke briefly to his girlfriend and got up to close the sliding door and curtains. Judge Thokozile Masipa questioned the reliability of several witnesses who said they heard screams and gunshots between about 03:12 and 03:17, saying most had 'got facts wrong'. Mr Pistorius said he heard the bathroom window sliding open and believed that an intruder, or intruders, had entered the bathroom through a window which was not fitted with burglar bars. Mr Pistorius said he grabbed his firearm and told Ms Steenkamp, who he thought was still in bed, to call the police. The judge said it made no sense that Ms Steenkamp did not hear him scream 'Get out' or call the police, as she had her mobile phone with her. Mr Pistorius could see the bathroom window was open and toilet door closed. He said he did not know whether the intruders were outside on a ladder or in the toilet. He had his firearm in front of him, he heard a movement inside the toilet and thought whoever was inside was coming out to attack him. 'Before I knew it, I had fired four shots at the door,' he said. The judge said she did not accept that Mr Pistorius fired the gun by accident or before he knew what was happening. She said he had armed himself with a lethal weapon and clearly wanted to use it. The other question, she said, was why he fired not one, but four shots before he ran back to the room to try to find Ms Steenkamp. Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bedroom and noticed that Ms Steenkamp was not there. Mr Pistorius said this was when he realised she could have been in the toilet and rushed back to the bathroom. Mr Pistorius said he screamed for help and went back to the bathroom where he found the toilet was locked. He returned to the bedroom, pulled on his prosthetic legs and turned on the lights before bashing in the toilet door with a cricket bat. When the door panel broke, he found the key and unlocked the door and found Ms Steenkamp slumped on the floor with her head on the toilet bowl.

The 28-year-old's death and the video footage of her arrest sparked outrage. The arresting officer, Brian Encinia, has been charged with allegedly lying about it, a prosecutor announced after a day of grand jury discussions. Hours later, he was fired from his job. The grand jury had picked out the officer's affidavit as behind their decision, said special prosecutor Shawn McDonald. In that affidavit, Mr Encinia had claimed that Ms Bland was \"combative and uncooperative\" after he pulled her over. The argument began after she was asked to put out her cigarette and he demanded she get out of her car. Video footage showed the police officer drawing his stun gun and threatening Ms Bland with the words: \"I will light you up!\" After the argument moved off-camera, she was heard screaming that he was about to break her wrists and she complained that her head knocked against the ground. Mr McDonald said grand jurors found Mr Encinia's statement that he had \"removed her from her vehicle to further conduct a safer traffic investigation\" to be false. Soon after the indictment, the Texas Department of Public Safety said \"termination proceedings\" would start immediately. Ms Bland's death three days after her arrest was ruled a suicide and the sheriff's officials and jailers were cleared of any crime.

Shrewsbury's best opportunity in the early stages fell to Ivan Toney but the Newcastle loanee's header from a Louis Dodds cross was comfortably saved by Alex Cairns. Dodds then had a close-range effort blocked as Shrewsbury, who reached the fifth round last season before bowing out to Manchester United, pushed for a breakthrough. Fleetwood midfielder Bobby Grant's overhead kick cleared the bar before visiting captain Nathan Pond's header from Kyle Dempsey's free-kick was acrobatically saved by Jayson Leutwiler, diving low to his right. Shrewsbury hit the same post twice within a minute early in the second half. A low shot from Dodds beat keeper Cairns but came out off the inside of a post before Junior Brown's flick from a Dom Smith cross also struck the woodwork. The Shrews continued to look the most likely side to break the deadlock and Toney's 25-yard free-kick clipped the top of the bar before Grant hammered a late shot from distance narrowly wide for Fleetwood as deadlock ensued.

And the crowd would \"ooh\" and \"aah\" as the prizefighter set about you, raining blows down above and below the belt. And so it was in the beautiful Simi Hills in California last night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library that the Republican candidates took it in turn to try to give Donald Trump a bloody nose, a cracked rib, a thick lip and black eye. Ideally all four at once. First up, flexing his muscles, and jabbing hard, was Senator Rand Paul on whether Trump had the character to have his hand on the nuclear trigger. \"I'm very concerned about him - having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his - his visceral response to attack people on their appearance - short, tall, fat, ugly - my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that?\" Good shot, Rand, but thwack came the response - \"I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there,\" said Trump. Cue laughter. Next up into the ring was Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. \"Mr Trump. We don't need an apprentice in the White House.\" But with a squint of those blue eyes, Trump shot back \"in Wisconsin, you're losing $2.2bn right now. I would do so much better than that.\" Jake Tapper, the excellent CNN host, didn't quite say \"roll up, roll up who else wants to take their chances against my boy?\" But he didn't need to. They were lining up. Hold on a minute. What's this? My, my, a lady is getting into the ring. Surely she wouldn't be able to draw blood where everyone else had failed. Well she did. The former Hewlett Packard boss Carly Fiorina had been roundly insulted by Trump when he questioned her suitability because of her appearance. He told Rolling Stone  - \"Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\" She was stoic and measured: \"I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said.\" And Trump was now visibly back-pedalling. \"I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman.\" Her face was acid. She did not flinch. It was a gotcha moment. And \"low energy\" Jeb Bush - as Donald Trump dubbed him -  achieved something similar when he gave a Trump a good kicking over the tycoon bringing Bush's Mexican-born wife into the political debate. Trump looked defensive. He wouldn't give the apology that Bush demanded, but he was discomfited. There was a lot of serious stuff in this sprawling three hour debate. But if you're in a fairground - well you want all the fun of the fair. And once again Donald Trump provided it.  He is still the focal point. But he saw tonight that his opponents are prepared to fight back. And so the circus moves on. So roll up next time to see whether the polls change, whether all those candidates can stay the course.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The finding deals a significant blow to the theory of physics known as supersymmetry. Many researchers had hoped the LHC would have confirmed this by now. Supersymmetry, or Susy, has gained popularity as a way to explain some of the inconsistencies in the traditional theory of subatomic physics known as the Standard Model. The new observation, reported at the Hadron Collider Physics conference in Kyoto and outlined in an as-yet unpublished paper, is not consistent with many of the most likely models of Susy. Prof Chris Parkes, who is the spokesperson for the UK participation in the LHCb experiment, told BBC News: \"Supersymmetry may not be dead but these latest results have certainly put it into hospital.\" Supersymmetry theorises the existence of more massive versions of particles that have already been detected. If found, they might help explain the phenomenon known as dark matter. Galaxies appear to rotate faster at their edges than the matter we see can account for, and one set of candidates for this missing dark matter is supersymmetric particles. However, researchers at the LHCb detector have dealt a serious blow to hopes of finding them. They have measured the decay between a particle known as a Bs meson into two particles known as muons. It is the first time that this decay has ever been observed, and the team has calculated that for every billion times that the Bs meson decays it only decays in this way three times. If superparticles were to exist, the decay would happen far more often. This experiment is one of the \"golden\" tests for supersymmetry, and it would appear that this hugely popular theory among physicists has failed. The result is at a statistical level of \"3.5 sigma\" - meaning that there is a one-in-4300 chance that the team would see the same \"bump\" in their data if the decay were not happening. This level makes the find worth further investigation, but falls well short of the 5-sigma level of certainty required for a formal discovery. Prof Val Gibson, leader of the Cambridge University LHCb team, said that the new result was \"putting our supersymmetry theory colleagues in a spin\". The results are in fact completely in line with what one would expect from the Standard Model. There is already concern that the LHCb's sister detectors might have expected to have detected superparticles by now, yet none has been found so far. If supersymmetry is not an explanation for dark matter, then theorists will have to find alternative ideas to explain those inconsistencies in the Standard Model. So far researchers who are racing to find evidence of so called \"new physics\" have run into a series of dead ends. \"If new physics exists, then it is hiding very well behind the Standard Model,\" commented Cambridge physicist Dr Marc-Olivier Bettler, a member of the analysis team. The result does not rule out the possibility that super particles exist. But according to Prof Parkes, \"they are running out of places to hide\". Supporters of supersymmetry, however, such as Prof John Ellis of King's College London, said that the observation is \"quite consistent with supersymmetry\". \"In fact,\" he said, \"(it) was actually expected in (some) supersymmetric models.  I certainly won't lose any sleep over the result.\" \u2022 The Standard Model is the simplest set of ingredients - elementary particles - needed to make up the world we see in the heavens and in the laboratory \u2022 Quarks combine together to make, for example, the proton and neutron - which make up the nuclei of atoms today - though more exotic combinations were around in the Universe's early days \u2022 Leptons come in charged and uncharged versions; electrons - the most familiar charged lepton - together with quarks make up all the matter we can see; the uncharged leptons are neutrinos, which rarely interact with matter \u2022 The \"force carriers\" are particles whose movements are observed as familiar forces such as those behind electricity and light (electromagnetism) and radioactive decay (the weak nuclear force) \u2022 The Higgs boson came about because although the Standard Model holds together neatly, nothing requires the particles to have mass; for a fuller theory, the Higgs - or something else - must fill in that gap Follow Pallab on Twitter\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Researchers at the Large Hadron Collider have detected one of the rarest particle decays seen in nature.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

A previous hearing in the case was told Fu had ordered him to sell drugs and he was worried before entering the flat because he had not sold enough. The attack began almost immediately and the court heard the pair subjected him to \"exceptional degradation\", holding him at knifepoint, burning him with cigarettes, and seriously sexually assaulting him. The ordeal lasted a number of hours before they released the teenager, who then contacted police. Speaking outside court, Mr Woods said: \"I thought I was going to die that night. I will never forget what happened.\" He described it as the \"worst experience of his life\". \"I didn't know what was going to happen and what they were going to do.

The film's star Shailene Woodley also picked up best female performance, the Trailblazer Award and best kiss for a scene with Ansel Elgort. Woodley gave an emotional speech dedicated to John Green, the author of the book which the film is based on, saying \"he gave this world a beautiful masterpiece\". Other winners included Bradley Cooper, who won best male performance for his role as the late Chris Kyle in American Sniper. The 40-year-old actor said: \"Chris Kyle would have turned 41 four days ago. Chris, this is for you,\" said Cooper. Channing Tatum took home best comedic performance for 22 Jump Street and Meryl Streep picked up best villain for her role in Into the Woods. Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Lawrence, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne were also among the winners. Kevin Hart, who was the target of many size-related jokes throughout the night, brought his kids on stage to accept the comedic genius award. He said: \"I do it all for them. I'm trying to leave a legacy behind.\" In one of the more energetic moments of the show, Robert Downey Jr brought his fellow Avengers stars to their knees while accepting the Generation Award. Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner all took the stage to present their co-star with the award, which Downey called \"the recognition I so desire\". Clips from the upcoming Pitch Perfect sequel, Judd Apatow's latest comedy Trainwreck and Marvel's new film Ultron were shown during a look ahead to this summer's releases.

The idea is that people climb to the top of Slievemartin outside Rostrevor - known locally as the Cairn - take a selfie and then post the picture on the 'Cairnuary' Facebook page. The mountain is 485m high, so Dr McLaughlin said if you climb it 31 times in a month, you've climbed higher than Everest. He said he could see how his patients have benefitted. \"January's a time when I see a lot of depression and this challenge is pretty good for mental health and physical health,\" Dr McLaughlin said. \"A lot of people buy exercise bikes and then they gather dust. So this is something that's free, they get to climb up the mountain every day for a month. \"It's a  good hard exercise, it takes them about an hour. \"They don't need exercise bikes and they don't need to join gyms and pay money for stuff, it's out there and they can discover the mountains.\" Those climbing the mountain can chose their own route - which could involve anything up to a 10km hike - or they can use a bike if they want. Dr McLaughlin said between 30 to 50 people were now climbing the mountain daily and all sorts of people are taking part. \"There's one lady who's a patient of mine who's been very ill in the past and has had surgeries to her feet and really shouldn't be able to do it, but she's going from the car park half way up the mountain and she's doing it every day,\" he said. \"There's people with depression doing it - I know it's good for them - people who are overweight doing it, there are people who are very healthy doing it as well. \"People are all very encouraging of each other.\" Dr McLaughlin said he climbed the mountain at about 06:00 GMT on Thursday and had eight other people for company. \"Normally you'd climb the mountain at six o'clock in the morning and you wouldn't see a soul,\" he said. The final climb will be a communal one on Sunday, but Dr McLaughlin said he hoped to come up with something else to keep his patients exercising. \"I'm hoping to follow it on with some sort of challenge for the rest of the year that will keep them doing stuff,\" he said. \"As far as I'm concerned, it's probably doing my work good in that maybe some people are going to get fit that I won't see. \"I'd recommend it to anybody.

{"article": "###\nArticle: To secure more rights for people with disabilities, she makes frequent visits to courtrooms where the world of beauty contests is but a dream. But the first Miss Wheelchair India contest in Mumbai in late November changed much of that. She found herself amid the humdrum of the green room, glitter of the stage and the usual chatter one associates with a beauty pageant. But there were some marked differences - the stage was much smaller than the ones set up for Miss India pageant and the contestants were treated as winners even before the event started. Ms Kewlani's reply is an emphatic \"no\" when asked if the smaller stage and venue dimmed the importance of India's first Miss Wheelchair contest. \"Nobody really cared about how many people attended the event or how big the stage was. It was a night to celebrate the courage and fighting spirit of the contestants. We all won that night.\" She says that her \"rich and challenging\" life has taken another positive turn after winning the contest. \"Polio made me wheelchair-bound early on in life but I never saw it as a disability and worked hard to be trained as a media professional like other normal people in the country. \"And winning the pageant is just another way of showing that disability cannot stop you from feeling and looking beautiful,\" the 41-year-old says. Divya Arora feels her first runner-up crown has strengthened her belief that \"beauty is boundless\". Ms Arora, who earlier worked for a leading newspaper, says her faith that \"disability can never overshadow her beauty and abilities\" helped her do well in the pageant. The contest is the idea of tax consultant Sounak Banerjee whose life changed in 2006 when muscular dystrophy forced him to use a wheelchair to get around in the bustling city of Mumbai. Mr Banerjee liked watching Bollywood films and TV shows but often found the absence of people with disabilities in the entertainment industry \"disturbing\". \"Disabled people are also consumers of the entertainment industry but they are seldom represented,\" he says. He then came up with the idea of the Miss Wheelchair India contest to fill the gap and provide a platform they could call their own. Planning the event was tough due to a lack of funding and human resources, he says but adds that the struggles were forgotten when the final day approached. \"I felt satisfied and happy when I saw these women wearing their best costumes and a winning smile. It all came together nicely in the end - I had done something for these courageous contestants,\" he says. \"I found the contest very unique because it honoured beauty irrespective of contestants' physical disabilities,\" says scientist Gopika Anand, 31, who won the second runner-up crown. Ms Anand met with a road accident while studying engineering and was soon confined to a wheelchair. But she persevered, completed her course and found work as a scientist at a leading consumer manufacturing firm. Shelly Bhutani, another contestant, hopes that the corporate world will take notice of the event in the future. \"I feel we too deserve to be in front of the camera and get brand endorsements like Miss India winners,\" she says. Ms Arora, however, felt the organisers were not well prepared for the event and did not provide the kind of support she had hoped for. Mr Banerjee accepts that a lack of sponsorship made the job of organising the event tough. \"I agree that there were problems at the event. We will work harder and hope that more people will support the event next year,\" he says. But other contestants want to see change at a more basic level. India is not known to be a disabled-friendly country as most public places, monuments and buildings do not have facilities catering to their specific needs. Bhavna Sharma, who won the contest in a category that honoured people who are disabled but not necessarily confined to a wheelchair, says citizens with disabilities do not feel inferior and have achieved success in almost every field. \"But it's the country's poor infrastructure for disabled people that lets us down,\" the 27-year-old says. Some years ago Neenu Kewlani travelled all over India in a chauffer-driven car to highlight the problems faced by those with physical challenges while commuting. She says the problem is even more severe in rural areas and smaller towns where people with disabilities are virtually confined to their homes. Nearly every contestant expressed concern over a lack of sensitivity about disability rights. But not one of them is willing to give up hope. Ms Kewlani says there is a long way to go in making India a disabled-friendly country but \"we are not ready to give up as we are fighters\". \"Facilities are improving in cities but we will continue to put pressure on governments to ensure they provide better opportunities and infrastructure for the disabled,\" she adds. Calcutta-based Sarmistha Sinha says disability rights activists will have to continue fighting like other marginalised sections of the society. An accident in 2006 confined the 41-year-old doctor to a wheelchair, but she says her \"thoughts and ability to stay positive remained free\". Ms Sinha won in a category which honoured married women in a wheelchair. But winning was not everything for her as she wanted to use the platform to showcase her talent. The wheelchair dancer saw the contest as an opportunity to present her skills and meet people like herself from all over the country. \"I only wanted to dance as such opportunities are rare but the feeling that I have won a beauty pageant is slowly sinking in,\" she adds. For Gopika Anand the real winning moment came when she saw her father's moist eyes as the results were announced. \"I was overwhelmed to see her with the crown. I am very proud today to be recognised as Gopika Anand's father,\" says Anand Mohan. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The Welsh government said the number of midwifery training places commissioned rose again this year. It also said all maternity units must meet recommendations on the number of midwives needed for safe services. It is the second year the RCM has carried out a State of Maternity Services report across Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. \"Wales saw a trimming of training numbers in 2011/12 compared to the previous year. It is for this reason, and the fall in midwife numbers there, that the RCM is putting Wales on watch,\" the report said. \"We are not yet ringing the alarm bell, but we are poised to do so; decision-makers in Wales must turn this deteriorating situation around.\" It went on that the the shortage of midwives that has emerged needs to be \"eliminated without delay\". \"The government in Cardiff should act now,\" the report said. \"The shortage we have identified in Wales should be easily eliminated - and we call on the government in Wales to do just that. \"Given the emerging shortage of midwives in Wales, the number of student midwife places needs to be sustained; any further cuts would put the future quality of maternity services at risk.\" Midwife numbers fell in Wales in the last annual survey in 2011, where figures were 12% lower than in 2008, and the RCM said it was the third year in a row in which the number of midwives working in the NHS in Wales was cut. \"Between 2001 and 2011 whilst the number of babies born jumped by just short of 5,000, the number of full-time equivalent midwives rose by just 35. \"In last year's State of Maternity Services report we reported on an emerging shortage of midwives in Wales. We believe that this remained in 2011; whilst the number of births dropped a little, the number of midwives dropped too.\" However, Wales has seen a 34% drop in births to girls aged under 16. In England, the number of NHS midwives has continued to climb because of the UK government's good work, according to the report. A Welsh government spokesperson said:  \"The numbers of midwifery training places commissioned has increased again this year from last year's numbers. \"Decisions about training places are based on what the NHS needs to maintain services, service development, the numbers and age profile of staff and the drop-out rate from the courses.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Giving evidence to the Iraq inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller said the action had radicalised \"a few among a generation\". As a result, she said she was not \"surprised\" that UK nationals were involved in the 7/7 bombings in London. She said she believed the intelligence on Iraq's threat was not \"substantial enough\" to justify the action. Baroness Manningham-Buller said she had advised officials a year before the war that the threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited\", and she believed that assessment had \"turned out to be the right judgement\". Describing the intelligence on Iraq's weapons threat as \"fragmentary\", she said: \"If you are going to go to war, you need to have a pretty high threshold to decide on that.\" In a previously secret document from 2002, Baroness Manningham-Buller wrote to the Home Office saying: \"We assess that Saddam is only likely to order terrorist attacks if he perceives that the survival of his regime is threatened.\" The Chilcot inquiry is continuing to hear evidence about decisions taken in the build-up to the invasion and its aftermath. Baroness Manningham-Buller, head of the domestic intelligence service between 2002 and 2007, said the terrorist threat to the UK from al-Qaeda and other groups \"pre-dated\" the Iraq invasion and also the 9/11 attacks in the US. However, she said the UK's participation in the March 2003 military action \"undoubtedly increased\" the level of terrorist threat. By Peter BilesBBC correspondent at the inquiry The former head of MI5 chose her words very carefully. Baroness Manningham-Buller was giving her evidence in public, although 35 witnesses have previously testified to the Iraq inquiry behind closed doors in order to protect national security or international relations. Key to her evidence was the release of the declassified assessment which she wrote in March 2002, a year before the invasion of Iraq. This played down the direct threat to the UK from Saddam Hussein's regime, and its possible links to al-Qaeda. As was expected, the focus of her evidence remained on the implications of the 2003 invasion for Britain, rather than the actual decision to go to war. Given the gravity of the situation, with 16 suspected terrorism plots uncovered in the UK between 2001 and 2008, it may be a surprise to some that she did not have direct conversations with Tony Blair during her time as head of MI5. A year after the invasion, she said MI5 was \"swamped\" by leads about terrorist threats to the UK. \"Our involvement in Iraq, for want of a better word, radicalised a whole generation of young people, some of them British citizens who saw our involvement in Iraq, on top of our involvement in Afghanistan, as being an attack on Islam,\" she said, before immediately correcting herself by adding \"not a whole generation, a few among a generation\". The ex-MI5 chief said she shared her concerns that the Iraq invasion would increase the UK's exposure to terrorism with the then home secretary David Blunkett, but did not \"recall\" discussing the matter with Prime Minister Tony Blair. MI5 did not \"foresee the degree to which British citizens would become involved\" in terrorist activity after 2004, she admitted. \"What Iraq did was produce fresh impetus on people prepared to engage in terrorism,\" she said, adding that she could produce evidence to back this up. \"The Iraq war heightened the extremist view that the West was trying to bring down Islam. We gave Bin Laden his jihad.\" Lady Manningham-Buller said MI5 was given a budget increase after 9/11 and again in 2002 but the agency still needed far greater resources as a result of the Iraq invasion. \"By 2003 I found it necessary to ask the prime minister for a doubling of our budget,\" she said. \"This is unheard of, certainly unheard of today, but he and the Treasury and the chancellor accepted that, because I was able to demonstrate the scale of the problem that we were confronted by.\" Baroness Manningham-Buller was part of the government's Joint Intelligence Committee before the war, which drew up the controversial dossier on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction in September 2002. The dossier stated the weapons could be activated with 45 minutes of an order to do so. Asked about the dossier, she said she had very limited involvement in its compilation but it was clear, with hindsight, that there was an \"over-reliance\" on certain intelligence. She added: \"We were asked to put in some low-grade, small intelligence into it and we refused because we did not think that it was reliable.\" She said MI5's responsibility was to collect and analyse intelligence and to \"act on it where necessary\" to mitigate terrorist threats, but stressed it was not her job \"to fill in gaps\" in the intelligence. A year before the war, the former MI5 chief advised Home Office officials that the direct threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited and containable\". In a newly declassified document, published by the inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller told the senior civil servant at the Home Office in March 2002 that there was no evidence that Iraq had any involvement in the 9/11 attacks. While there were reports of links between the regime of Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, there was no intelligence to suggest meaningful co-operation between the two. In that letter, she said the possibility Iraq might use terrorist tactics to defend its own territory in the event of an invasion could not be ruled out. But she stressed Iraqi agents did not have \"much capability\" to carry out UK attacks, adding her view of this never changed. In his evidence in January, Tony Blair described Saddam Hussein as a \"monster\" and said the world was a safer place with him no longer in control of Iraq.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The invasion of Iraq \"substantially\" increased the terrorist threat to the UK, the former head of MI5 has said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: In a strongly worded letter to all teachers, Gavin Boyd also said they got better pay than their counterparts in England and Wales. Teaching unions are refusing to co-operate with school inspections in a dispute over pay and workload. Some are also taking occasional strike action. The National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers (NASUWT) has reacted angrily to Mr Boyd's letter, accusing him of \"fake news\". Mr Boyd is chief executive of the Education Authority and represents the teaching employers in negotiations over the current pay dispute. He wrote that the industrial action was \"seriously affecting the education of children and young people\" and \"the effective operation of schools\". He also said teachers had been \"confused by misinformation\" on a number of issues. \"The average teacher's pay in Northern Ireland is just over \u00c2\u00a340,000 per annum,\" he added. \"This compares very favourably with other graduate professions locally and is actually higher than the average teacher's pay in England and Wales.\" He said that teaching unions had rejected an overall offer of 2.5% on pay in 2015-16. \"There have been no reductions in teacher's pay,\" he said. Mr Boyd conceded that national insurance and pension contributions had risen, but said these were \"part of a wider government strategy to ensure public sector pensions remain affordable and sustainable\". \"Public sector pensions remain attractive and in general offer much better terms than those available in the private sector.\" However, the NASUWT's general secretary Chris Keates said his letter would infuriate teachers. \"Teachers will not be persuaded or intimidated by the fake news presented in the letter,\" she said. \"The value of teachers' pay has fallen by around 20% since 2010. \"The employers should start to devote more of their time to addressing the genuine concerns of teachers rather than peddling misinformation.\" The letter will not help to resolve disputes between teachers and their employers, said Heather Watson, the principal of Phoenix Integrated Primary School in Cookstown, County Tyrone. She was \"shocked, confused and disappointed\" when she received the letter. \"It hasn't done anything to reassure teachers that they are respected and valued,\" said Ms Watson. \"I understand that there are two sides to this, but I really want the two sides to get their act together and address the issues.\" Jim Clarke, the chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, which represents teachers' employers, said the information in the letter was \"factually accurate\". \"It might not necessarily agree with everyone's perspective but all we can do is present the facts as they are,\" he added. In a related development, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) has accused the Department of Education of \"attempts at bullying\" by writing to a Catholic archbishop about the ongoing industrial action.

Meanwhile more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports. The Home Office is \"considering\" calls for tougher rules on alcohol. The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area. Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane. A total of 19,000 of the Unite union's cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse. A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: \"People just see us as barmaids in the sky. \"They would touch your breasts, or they'd touch your bum or your legs. I've had hands going up my skirt before.\" In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntary code of conduct on disruptive passengers, which most of the big airlines and airports signed up to. The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff are also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appear drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working. One anonymous crew member told Panorama: \"The code of conduct isn't working\u2026 We're seeing these incidents on a daily, a weekly, a monthly basis. It's the alcohol mainly in the duty free that is the significant problem.\" Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum** Manchester Airport is one of the signatories but when Panorama's undercover reporter asked at World Duty Free whether she could open alcohol bought at a duty-free shop to consume on the plane, she was told \"officially probably not, unofficially I think you'll get away with it\". Another shop in the airport did give the right advice. World Duty Free said it was committed to dealing with the issue and that it displays \"clear advisory notices at till points, on till receipts and on carrier bags that remind customers that alcohol purchases cannot be opened until their final destination is reached\". Airlines UK, which represents carriers such as Virgin, British Airways and EasyJet, wants the government to amend the law to make consumption of a passenger's own alcohol on board an aircraft a criminal offence. Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights. Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed. \"I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well. \"Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, they're items that are not sold on the high street. \"We can't allow it not to change.\" A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports. Committee chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering said: \"We didn't hear one shred of evidence to show the voluntary code was either working now or had any possible vestige of success in working any time soon.\" The Home Office said it was considering the report's recommendations, which include revoking the airports' exemption from the Licensing Act, \"and will respond in due course\". Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: \"I don't accept that the airports don't sell alcohol responsibly. The sale of alcohol per se is not a problem.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The US ambassador to Bangladesh condemned the killing of Xulhaz Mannan, who also worked at the US embassy. Another person was also injured when the attackers entered a Dhaka flat. Since February last year suspected militants have killed several secular or atheist writers and members of religious minority groups. The two men were murdered two days after a university teacher was hacked to death by suspected Islamist militants. So-called Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility - but the Bangladeshi government insists there is no IS presence in the country. Lurching from secularism to sectarian terror? Who is behind the Bangladesh killings? \"I am devastated by the brutal murder of Xulhaz Mannan and another young Bangladeshi,\" said US Ambassador Marcia Bernicat. \"We abhor this senseless act of violence and urge the government of Bangladesh in the strongest terms to apprehend the criminals behind these murders,\" she added. BBC Bengali Service editor Sabir Mustafa said staff at Roopbaan, a magazine and activist group for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community that had not been condemned by the government and received some support from foreign embassies, had been careful to protect their identities but had not believed their lives were at risk. Suspected extremists in Bangladesh are gaining a sense of security that they can carry out killings with impunity, he says. A British photographer who knew Mr Mannan and the other victim, known as \"Tonoy\" and named in Bangladeshi media as Tanay Mojumdar, said they and other friends had set up Roopbaan with the aim of spreading tolerance. Homosexuality is technically illegal in Bangladesh and remains a highly sensitive issue in society. Both men were openly gay and believed that if more gay Bangladeshis came out then the country would have to accept them, the photographer, who asked not to be named, said. They were also were behind the annual \"Rainbow Rally\", held on Bengali New Year, 14 April, since 2014. This year's rally was banned by police as part of widespread security measures. \"Both were extremely gentle, non-violent and aware that being openly gay and active in their work was a personal danger,\" the photographer said. Their killings were likely to spread fear among Bangladesh's gay community, he said. \"Until a year ago the only threat to coming out was shame of the family and having to start a new life elsewhere in Bangladesh. Now it's one of danger,\" he said. Meanwhile Bangladesh's best known blogger said he had received a death threat on Sunday. Imran Sarker, who led major protests by secular activists in 2013 against Islamist leaders, said he had received a phone call warning that he would be killed \"very soon\". Earlier this month, a Bangladeshi law student who had expressed secular views online died when he was hacked with machetes and then shot in Dhaka. Last year, four prominent secular bloggers were also killed with machetes. The four bloggers had all appeared on a list of 84 \"atheist bloggers\" drawn up by Islamic groups in 2013 and widely circulated. There have also been attacks on members of religious minorities including Shia, Sufi and Ahmadi Muslims, Christians and Hindus. Two foreigners - an Italian aid worker and a Japanese farmer - have also been killed.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The shipment will be the first potentially preventative medicine to reach one of the hardest hit countries. But experts say that, with Ebola cases falling, it may be difficult to establish whether the jab offers any protection against the virus. It has been produced by British company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the US National Institutes of Health. GSK said a plane carrying some 300 initial doses of the vaccine was expected to arrive in Monrovia on Friday. And the company hopes the first volunteer will be immunised in the next few weeks. The chief executive of GSK, Sir Andrew Witty, said the pace of development was almost unparalleled and was comparable to only the development of a pandemic flu vaccine or new medicines for HIV. He told the BBC: \"As an example we have delayed two other vaccine development programmes to free up the space to do this work, so this has come with a significant amount of disruption.\" Scientists aim to involve 30,000 volunteers in the trial in total, including frontline health workers. If all regulations are met, 10,000 volunteers will be given the GSK vaccine. A matching number will get a placebo, dummy vaccine. And there are plans for a further 10,000 people to get a separate experimental jab. The results will be compared to see if either vaccine offers any meaningful protection against the virus. A version of the vaccine has already been tested on 200 healthy volunteers across the UK, US, Switzerland and Mali. GSK says it has been found to have an acceptable safety profile so far. But it is only in affected countries that experts can determine whether it provides adequate protection against the virus. Dr Moncef Slaoui, of GlaxoSmithKline said: \"Shipping the vaccine today is a major achievement and shows that we remain on track with the accelerated development of our candidate Ebola vaccine. \"The initial phase one data we have seen are encouraging and give us confidence to progress to the next phases of clinical testing.\" The company stresses the vaccine is still in development and the World Health Organization, and other regulators, would have to be satisfied the vaccine is both safe and effective before any mass immunisation campaigns could be considered. Field trials of other promising vaccines - for example one involving the company Merck - are planned in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the months to come. And there are reports that a trial of an experimental drug called Zmapp might start in the next few weeks. However, experts say with the number of Ebola cases falling opportunities to test vaccines and drugs could be limited. Prof Jonathan Ball, a virus expert based at Nottingham University, told the BBC: \"Because case numbers are starting to come down it will become harder and harder to show if the vaccine is having any impact. \"Ultimately we may be in position in a few months time where we don't know whether this vaccine is effective in humans. \"But it is important to get answers if we can - if not for this outbreak, for future outbreaks.

Although more men still die from lung cancer there has been a 40% drop in the rate among males over the same period. The charity said the figures reflected smoking trends in the UK, with the number of male smokers falling from the 1950s. It was not until two decades later that the number of female smokers began dropping significantly. Lung cancer is the most common cancer in Scotland and also the biggest killer of all the cancers, according to the charity. About 4,200 people die of the disease every year in Scotland, and about 86% of all cases are linked to tobacco. It also has one of the lowest survival rates, with more than two-thirds of patients diagnosed too late for them to be offered successful treatment. Cancer Research has called for an increased awareness of the disease and more fundraising to help fight it. Director of early diagnosis Sara Hiom said: \"We need to improve awareness of the possible signs and symptoms of lung cancer and urge people - especially those at increased risk - to go to their doctor without delay if they spot any symptoms. \"We know that if people go to their GP as soon as they're aware of symptoms it can make all the difference and save lives. \"Look out for feeling more breathless than usual or for much of the time, a cough that has lasted longer than three weeks, an existing cough that has changed or got worse or coughing up blood.

She said: \"Mum was ill for such a long time and we had to push her to go back and back to the doctor as she was one of those people who didn't want to waste her doctor's time.

The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two. Its director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic. What does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year? The fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer. We originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence. What makes All My Sons an American classic? The themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down. The themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall. The 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later? I haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure. I read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad. Given that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round? Like with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth. Does having a black cast give the play a new perspective? It certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US. But it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family. You took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve? I'm just at the beginning. The past three years have been great and we are starting to achieve some of things we set out to do. It's great that we get do do All My Sons, and we get to work with the companies like the  National Theatre as we did last year with Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. We've got a writers' programme working with the Bush and Soho Theatres and the BBC, and we have a space we are desperate to develop into a 100-seat venue. We are looking for funding to do that. What's the latest on workshops you've had with Lenny Henry on a play about the American comedian Richard Pryor? We are still in the workshopping process. It's in development. I hope it will come to the stage. We are both keen to see it happen. All My Sons, with a cast led by Ray Shell and Dona Croll, has opened at Ipswich's New Wolsey Theatre, and tours until 25 April. A full list of tour dates is on the Talawa website. Following its sell-out run at the Young Vic, A View from the Bridge, with Mark Strong leading the cast, opens at the West End's Wyndham's Theatre on 16 February, and is now in preview. The RSC's production of Miller's 1949 Pulitzer prize-winning Death of a Salesman begins previews in March at Stratford-upon-Avon, with Antony Sher and Alex Hassell as father and son, Willy Loman and Biff.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, the Islamic Action Front, called for broader political representation and a more democratic parliament. People at the protest chanted: \"The people want to reform the regime.\" On Thursday evening, the king dissolved parliament and called early elections, though he did not specify a date. He has said he wants polls to be held by the end of the year. The IAF said it expected 50,000 people to take part in the protest outside the capital's al-Husseini mosque after Friday prayers. But the BBC's Wyre Davies put the turnout at 10,000 people, which he said was the biggest protest seen in Jordan for several years. Video footage showed protesters chanting slogans and waving flags. The AFP news agency quoted people as shouting: \"We demand constitutional reform before the people revolt. The people want to reform the regime.\" A counter-rally, in support of King Abdullah, which organisers had predicted would attract 200,000 supporters, was cancelled late on Thursday in order to prevent clashes between the two groups. Earlier, police said they had detained eight people travelling towards the rally and had seized three vehicles containing sticks, knives and guns. Friday's protest in the capital and the dissolution of parliament come amid mounting opposition anger at the electoral law passed in July by the government of the conservative Prime Minister Fayez al-Tarawneh. The electoral law increased the number of seats in the House of Representatives from 120 to 150 seats and gave the electorate two votes - one for a district representative and one for national level lists that include political parties - replacing the single non-transferable vote. The IAF's leader, Hamza Mansour, dismissed the legislation as \"just a cosmetic change meant to buy time and insufficient for real reforms\". Opposition parties demanded that 50% of seats be allocated to party lists, but the new electoral law gave them just 27 seats, or 18%. They also complained that the new law would strengthen supporters of the king by allocating three more seats for women from Bedouin districts. This, they argued, would continue to marginalise Jordanians of Palestinian origin - who make up 60% of the population but have little political power - in favour of those descended from Jordan's original Bedouin inhabitants - whose tribes dominate the government and security forces and are the bedrock of the Hashemite monarchy. Traditionally, many of the IAF's supporters have been Jordanians of Palestinian origin. The opposition also demanded that parliament, rather than the king, should have the right to appoint and dismiss the prime minister. Despite the call for reforms, Jordan has so far avoided the unrest and political upheaval that rocked much of the Arab world last year. Protests have been relatively small and have not gained the same level of political momentum as those in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria.

Bellfield, 47, was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for murdering the schoolgirl. Surrey Police confirmed it had received a letter from Bellfield's solicitors but said it was standing by its statement on the confession. Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Ms Cooper said Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim, believed a \"covert tape\" may have been used to record his response to a police interview in prison. She said \"my client denies giving a confession\". She has written to Surrey Police requesting the tape recording and notes from the meeting. Ms Cooper said Bellfield contacted her very soon after Surrey Police distributed its press statement relating to the Dowler case. She said Bellfield denies all the crimes for which he has been convicted. Last month, Surrey Police revealed Bellfield had made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly. The force said it stood by its original statement. A police source speaking to the BBC would not comment on how the admission was recorded. Milly's body was found 25 miles away from where she was kidnapped, in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Experts could not say how she died. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager following a trial at the Old Bailey where a judge described him as a \"cruel and pitiless killer\". He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly. He lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004. On Wednesday, the Dowler family revealed harrowing details of Milly's final hours, saying they had been made aware of her suffering last year after Bellfield had spoken to police.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Serial killer Levi Bellfield has denied confessing to the abduction, rape and killing of 13-year-old Milly Dowler.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Media playback is not supported on this device \"Even if Rangers were to win (on Sunday), I don't think they will finish second. Aberdeen have been so consistent, especially at home, so I fully expect Rangers to lose.\" The Dons have made Pittodrie a fortress this season, embarking on a 10-game winning streak on their home patch. They may have been eased aside by all-conquering Celtic in November's League Cup final, but have the chance to reach another national showpiece when they face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup last four on 22 April. \"Derek can't win the league, not against this Celtic side,\" Thompson added. \"Success can be measured in other ways. To reach both cup finals would be success in itself, to finish second, to get European football again, to break records - I'm not sure what else he can do. \"The consistency they've shown in the last two seasons has been phenomenal. I just think there aren't enough plaudits out there for Derek McInnes and the work he's done.\" Meanwhile, former Rangers player Thompson admits he has been baffled by the actions of new Ibrox boss, Pedro Caixinha. The Portuguese took the unusual step of revealing his team line-up a day before Wednesday's goalless draw with Kilmarnock, and two days ahead of their showdown with the Dons predicted the starting XI McInnes would select. Media playback is not supported on this device \"For me, it's nonsensical to give the opposition your team,\" Thompson said. \"It gives them extra time to prepare, and insight into how they're going to go about beating your side. \"I've never worked under a manager who would consider giving away his team lines, let alone a day before like he did. I found that puzzling. \"Possibly even more puzzling was to name the Aberdeen team.

Is it mind games? It's not very good mind games, if you ask me.\" Thompson, who made over 60 appearances for Rangers, says Caixinha's carefree style sits in stark contrast with the rigidity and structure of his predecessor, Mark Warburton. The 46-year-old led the Gers to a thumping win over Hamilton Academical in his first game in charge, but has since dropped points with successive draws against Motherwell and Kilmarnock. \"It's far too early to be making judgements,\" Thompson asserted. \"None of these players are Caixinha's players. I suspect in the summer you'll see a substantial recruitment drive. \"One thing that struck me is he's not afraid to do something radical. I know he had injury problems, but he took off three of his back-four, completely changed his shape against Motherwell.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Uzbek government announced his death on Friday after a period of rumours about his ill health. As is often the case with strongman regimes, no tried and tested succession mechanism is in place in Uzbekistan, and the transition of power may well be a complicated process. Uzbekistan is the most populous Central Asian country and has the largest army. Mr Karimov, who came to power during the Soviet era, has led the country since independence in 1991. During his long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism. But many believe this has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition. It also has not completely eradicated the long-term risk posed by Islamist militancy. Many Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, they might be tempted to come back. Some also say that Uzbekistan's fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost its appeal in the majority Muslim country. Positioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history. Most recently, it has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold. In 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use its air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington's criticism of the Uzbek government's human rights record. Moscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov's successor leans towards Russia rather than the West. So far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Political instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders. The country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets. Tension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Regional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China. Uzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts. President Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. This, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country. Should it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing. President Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Wales in the 13th Century was a mixture of regional powers. By the middle of the previous century, most of the lowland areas, particularly in south Wales, were under English control, in the form of Anglo-Norman barons from the Marches and across Glamorganshire to Pembroke. Gwynedd and the north-west of Wales remained largely independent. Welsh princes acknowledged the ruler Llywelyn the Great and his successor Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as the overarching Prince of Wales. But as the century wore away, and Edward I of England came to power, the balance of power changed as Llywelyn refused to pay tribute to Edward. In 1276 Edward I led an invasion into Gwynedd and forced Llywelyn into the very top corner of the country, and set about his castle-building programme. An uprising in 1282 led to renewed fighting, and saw the death of Llywelyn. By the following year it was over, and English domination over Wales was entrenched. Edward's son, the future Edward II, was created Prince of Wales. At the start of the 1200s, Welsh was the language of the common people. It was how people did business, conducted family life and worshipped. By the end of the century, daily business was increasingly done in English. English settlers were encouraged to move to Wales by free land grants and the imposition of English law. As the settlers moved into the more fruitful lowlands, Welsh speakers were increasingly pushed to the higher ground, although there was crossover between the two. One of the main changes through the course of the 13th Century was the difference in the way people paid for things. According to Dr Mark Redknap, head of collections and research in the history department at the Museum of Welsh Life, the old system of \"render\" was starting to change. \"It's fair to say that from about the end of the 13th Century the Welsh were more familiar with using money than they had been a century earlier,\" he said. \"You had an increasing use of coinage whereas there is very much a barter economy with the pre-Norman period, and payment in kind.\" He said taxes to the English king were paid in cash. Coinage though was still more at the stage where the actual weight of the coins, in silver for example, was what provided the value rather than a nominal amount printed on the coin. As well as tithes paid to the church, Llywelyn had tried to levy tax on cattle and in lieu of military service. But it was Edward I who pushed formalised tax collection. By the time of his death in 1307, tax revenue from Wales had tripled. According to Gerald of Wales, the Welsh were a militaristic society, more concerned with learning to fight rather than ploughing their land more than necessary. But this only applied to free men: about a third of the population at the start of the century were bonded to a lord and worked for them on large estates. The common people wore simple clothes: a tunic and thin cloak. Although much of Wales was rural, with large forests being an important source of food and resources for many, fledgling towns had been established by the Normans in places like Carmarthen and Cardiff and by the end of the century there were around 90 small towns, although few had populations over 1,000. It is worth remembering that the population of Wales was tiny in comparison to now, with the whole population equivalent to modern-day Cardiff.

The coach, which was heading to Cologne in Germany for a languages trip, hit a bridge on the A18 (E40) near Middelkerke during the morning of 28 June.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Well claimed the ball had crossed the line when home keeper David Mitchell collided with a post while clutching an over-hit Scott McDonald cross. Cammy Kerr set up Craig Wighton then followed up to score after keeper Craig Samson blocked the striker's shot. Marcus Haber side-footed home the second from striker Wighton's cut-back. A second win in a row lifts Paul Hartley's side off the bottom of the Scottish Premiership table ahead of Ross County, who host Rangers on Sunday, and level with the visitors and Hamilton Accies. Media playback is not supported on this device The ghost goal will haunt the match officials all weekend. On the right flank, striker McDonald looped in a cross that was careering towards the top corner. Mitchell began to furiously back-pedal as it became clear the ball was hurtling towards the back of the net. The goalkeeper grabbed at the ball, but its movement, plus his momentum, carried him and the ball a good yard over the line. There was amazement when the officials then decided no goal had been scored. Motherwell - players, backroom staff and fans - were incensed, and no wonder. A crucial moment that had a huge bearing on this match as Dundee took control. Wighton has been a hotly tipped young prospect for some time. Against Well, he was excellent. There was a lot of huff and puff from Dundee in the first-half, but that little bit of quality in the final third came from the jinking feet of the 19-year-old. The striker has imagination, skill, awareness and a directness that frightens defenders. He created both goals. For the first, his effort was saved before Cammy Kerr fired home the rebound. For the second, Wighton showed skill, strength and drive before cutting back for Haber to score his first Dundee goal. Wighton almost capped his superb display with a great run and shot that was well saved by Samson. He deserved a goal for his all-round display. A lot has been said about how tight the Premiership is this season, as long as runaway leaders Celtic are taken out of the equation. That was the case here for large parts, although the ghost goal incident was pivotal in this game. Dundee were the better side after taking the lead, but Motherwell were the better side for most of the first-half. They created several chances - McDonald had a close-range header saved, Lionel Ainsworth had a corner tipped on to the bar and a shot blocked. The ghost goal changed this game. From there, Dundee took their chance, got their goal, took control and - crucially - got themselves off the bottom of the table for a while at least. Media playback is not supported on this device Dundee manager Paul Hartley: \"The first home win of the season. I felt we deserved that today. \"We might have got a wee bit of a break with Motherwell's so-called goal, I haven't really seen it, but it's the breaks that we have not had. \"I felt we were comfortable today in the way that we played. Second-half, I thought we were excellent and we deserved that today. \"Craig Wighton has been around and about the squad from a young age, from 15, a lot of expectation put on his shoulders, but we have tried to ease him in there at times. \"But now we feel has matured, he has got stronger and you have seen in his performance today and even last week there is a different side to him now in terms of on the ball but even off the ball in his defensive work. \"Craig has got such outstanding ability and talent and that is the standard he has set himself now. I think it's his time now.\" Motherwell manager Mark McGhee: \"I have seen the video again, I saw it at the time, I could see clearly. The boy's feet are over the line, the balls ahead of him. \"There is absolutely no doubt it is a goal. It is an absolutely shocking decision. \"I just asked [the referee] for an explanation. Of course they don't speak to you. \"I'm as angry with my own team's first-half performance as I am with the referee's decision, or the linesman's decision. \"We made poor decisions, we never did the things we spoke about - getting down the sides of their back three.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Craig Bryson gave the Rams an early lead when he struck from the edge of the area, before Thomas Ince curled in a stunning effort to double the lead. Shortly after Bryson hit the crossbar, Darren Bent added a third when he headed home from close range. Ipswich struggled for clear-cut chances, while Derby missed several. Ince, whose earlier effort came after he drifted in from the right to score his 11th goal of the season, could only hit the post from a low cross by Bent in the second half. Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski also made smart saves from both Bent and Jacob Butterfield. The hosts had a late penalty appeal when Grant Ward went down in the area, shortly before Kieffer Moore's shot was deflected wide on his home debut. The result leaves the hosts with just one win from their last seven games, a run which included being knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln City. There was further bad news for McCarthy's men, with influential forward Tom Lawrence replaced at half-time because of injury. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: \"It looked like an ordinary start from both teams, but the first goal was far too easy for me, as was the second. \"We'd had a bit of a rally just before the third goal, when we should have scored from a corner kick, but then we give the ball away and it ends up in the net. \"It's quite clearly a foul in the build-up, which is not irrelevant because at 2-0 we could maybe get back in it, but 3-0 has put the game to bed.\" Derby manager Steve McClaren: \"We should have scored more goals, but you can't have everything.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Benchmark Brent crude hit $50.22 per barrel at one stage on Thursday, its highest level since early November. The rise followed US data showing that oil inventories had fallen after supply disruptions due to fires in Canada. Brent crude has now risen 80% since it hit 13-year lows of below $28 a barrel at the start of the year. US crude oil inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels to 537.1 million barrels in the week to May 20, according to US Department of Energy data. Canada is the biggest supplier to the US and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day. Talks in recent months between Opec and Russia about freezing oil production had already encouraged a price rise. Short-term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price, offsetting higher production from Iran and Saudi Arabia. As well as the disruption to key oil production facilities in Canada, attacks by militant groups continue to restrict oil pipelines in Nigeria. Demand has also been better than expected from major economies such as China, India and Russia. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"We do now appear to be seeing the effects that the decline in US output is having, and while supplies remain elevated, the glut does now appear to be diminishing.\" Against this backdrop, analysts are starting to raise their forecasts. Goldman Sachs said earlier this month that it now expected oil prices to consistently hit $50 a barrel in the second half of 2016 and $60 by the end of 2017. The US bank said: \"The oil market continues to deliver its share of surprises, with low prices driving disruptions in Nigeria, higher output in Iran and better demand. \"With each of these shifts significant in magnitude, the oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.\" In a sign of growing confidence, oil companies have started preparing for higher prices. BP said last month it had budgeted for prices of at least between $50 and $55 a barrel in 2017. And last month US oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources announced plans to add up to 10 new rigs when the oil price gets back up to $50. Adam Laird, an investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC: \"This is an area that's been starved of resources and investment and that psychological barrier [of $50] could be enough to make some executives reassess.\" However, Mr Laird cautioned that price volatility was likely to continue. \"It's too early to say this is the beginning of the big rebound,\" he said. Abhishek Deshpande, an oil markets analyst at Natixis, agreed and said: \"We believe that the market is going up, but if it goes too quickly there will be auto-corrections.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The price of oil has gone above $50 a barrel for the first time in 2016 as supply disruptions and increased global demand continue to fuel a recovery.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: It said just 8% of councils had built enough to replace half of their stock sold through the scheme, which allows council tenants to buy their homes. The charity said there was a danger of some areas having no affordable homes. The government said it was committed to building 275,000 affordable new homes over the course of this parliament. Right to Buy was first introduced in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government and was given a boost in 2012 when discounts for tenants were increased to \u00c2\u00a375,000. In this year's Queen's speech the government announced the scheme was being extended to 1.3m housing association tenants in England. Shelter, which looked at provisional figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government, said just two of the 166 councils in England listed as selling properties through Right to Buy had succeeded in replacing more than 100% of the properties sold. Under existing policy, the government has promised that each home sold after 2012 would be replaced. The charity's chief executive Campbell Robb warned the problem of not enough council homes being replaced was only likely to get worse, leaving some areas with no affordable homes. \"At this rate they'll soon be black-spots across the country where no-one on a normal income can afford to live,\" he said. 1.

LGA housing spokesman Peter Box said: \"It is imperative that councils are given the powers to replace housing sold through Right to Buy quickly and effectively as part of the Spending Review. \"Councils need to be able to retain 100% of receipts from sales while Right to Buy discounts should be set locally so they reflect the cost of houses in the area.\" Mr Box said the LGA estimated this would allow councils to replace 50,000 homes sold over the lifetime of the next Parliament. The government said nearly 40,000 new homeowners had been created since it increased discounts for council tenants in 2012. A spokesman added: \"Councils are continuing to fulfil the requirement to deliver one for one replacements within three years, and over 3,000 replacement homes have already been delivered across England. \"We have been absolutely clear that if councils do not deliver one for one replacements for the additional homes sold under Right to Buy the government will.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "One in three councils in England has not replaced a single home sold through the Right to Buy scheme since 2012, according to the charity Shelter.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Under the proposals, 120,000 additional asylum seekers will be distributed among EU nations, with binding quotas. It comes after a surge of thousands of mainly Syrian migrants pushed north through Europe in recent days. Mr Juncker told the European Parliament it was \"not a time to take fright\". Germany, the main destination for many migrants, supports quotas, but some EU countries oppose a compulsory system. Mr Juncker's plans were set out in a \"state of the union\" annual address in which he outlined the priorities of the European Commission. He opened his speech by admitting the European Union was \"not in a good situation. There is a lack of Europe in this union, and a lack of union in this union\". He said tackling the crisis was \"a matter of humanity and human dignity. It is true that Europe cannot house all the misery in the world. But we have to put it into perspective. \"This still represents just 0.11% of the EU population. In Lebanon refugees represent 25% of the population.\" The mass migration has seen those seeking an end to persecution, conflict and hardship travel from Turkey across the sea to Greece, through Macedonia and Serbia, and then to Hungary from where they aim to reach Austria, Germany and Sweden. On Wednesday, Denmark suspended all rail links with Germany and shut a section of motorway after migrants crossed the border and began walking north, apparently trying to reach Sweden. In southern Hungary, migrants on the border with Serbia broke through police lines at the Roszke camp, forcing the closure of the M5 highway. Among Mr Juncker's proposals: \"It's 160,000 refugees in total that Europeans have to take into their arms and I really hope that this time everyone will be on board - no rhetoric, action is what is needed,\" he told MEPs. The new plans would relocate 60% of those now in Italy, Greece and Hungary to Germany, France and Spain. The numbers allocated to each country would depend on GDP, population, unemployment rate and asylum applications already processed. Countries refusing to take in migrants could face financial penalties. 14 Sept: Special meeting of EU interior ministers on refugee crisis, with Juncker proposals on agenda 15-16 Oct: EU leaders' summit, with refugee crisis high on agenda.

Spain on Wednesday said it would accept a quota of almost 15,000 extra migrants migrants set by EU. However Mr Juncker's proposals was criticised by both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said compulsory quotas were \"not a good solution\", while his Slovak counterpart called them \"irrational\". Poland and Romania have also opposed the idea, although Poland has agreed to take in more migrants. France welcomed the first of 1,000 migrants it has pledged to take from Germany, having committed to receive 24,000 migrants over two years. In a separate development Australia has announced plans to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees. Germany has welcomed Syrian migrants, waiving EU rules and saying it expects to deal with 800,000 asylum seekers this year alone - though not all will qualify as refugees and some will be sent back. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany needed to learn from its mistakes in labelling incomers in the post-war period as \"Gastarbeiter\" or \"guest workers\" - with the implication that they were not permanent residents. Many of the refugees it expects in future \"will become new citizens of our country\", she said. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

The Cardozas called it a \"Joint Venture Fee\" - money paid to one party to help carry out a jointly-run project - but 1st Land said it was a loan. It is unclear what has since happened to the money. The \u00a310.25m loan was originally paid to the League Two club for the redevelopment of the new East Stand at Sixfields Stadium, along with a hotel and conference centre - none of which have been completed. Contractors Buckingham Group were appointed to carry out the works, with 1st Land appointed to oversee the development. When the company went into administration, it owed Northampton Town \u00a37.3m and Buckingham Group more than \u00a32m. The Cardozas and fellow businessmen, Howard Grossman, his son Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick, feature as directors of several firms with business links to 1st Land and a second company appointed to oversee the development - County Developments (Northampton) Limited or CDNL. Many of these companies have gone into liquidation. Howard Grossman is listed as the only director of 1st Land; which is owned by another Grossman firm, County Group. The administrators' report also lists payments of \u00a3314,000 to Howard Grossman for his salary; \u00a31.475m to County Homes (Herts) Ltd and \u00a3233,000 to County Cemetery Services Limited. The director of County Homes is also Howard Grossman. County Cemetery Services lists two current directors: Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick. David Cardoza was a director of the company until August last year. It has also gone into administration - but not before a sale agreement was made with a company called Centurion Infinity Limited; whose directors are Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick. After the collapse of 1st Land, CDNL took over the job of facilitating the Sixfields development. Its current directors are listed as David and Anthony Cardoza, while Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick resigned directorships in January. That company has now also entered liquidation. The club faces a winding-up petition, due to be heard on 16 November, from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A football club chairman and his father were given a \"loan\" of more than \u00a32.5m by a company set up to oversee the development of its stadium.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: It began on Friday when Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the southern Russian republic, labelled opponents of President Vladimir Putin \"enemies of the people\" and called for such \"traitors\" to be prosecuted for subversion, claiming they were working in league with the West. Mr Kadyrov has now re-asserted his claims and gone even further in an online editorial for pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia. Referring to a \"half-witted rabble\", he offered opposition activists the services of a Chechen psychiatric hospital to treat their \"mass psychosis\". \"I promise we won't spare the injections. We can do double,\" he wrote. A boxer-turned-insurgent and now a self-styled \"foot soldier\" of President Putin, the man known simply as Ramzan is not someone many in Russia dare criticise openly. Human rights groups have long accused him of presiding over widespread abuses in the Russian republic, and the key suspect in last year's shock shooting of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov beside the Kremlin walls had been deputy commander of one of his elite battalions. He was referred to by Ramzan as a \"true patriot\". This time, the Chechen leader's comments appear to have touched a nerve. The most dramatic response came from a little-known independent politician in Siberia, who raged against Ramzan on his Facebook page as the \"shame of Russia\". \"Why don't you get lost?\" Konstantin Senchenko told him, and let \"normal, honest people\" work for the good of the country. But the Siberian was soon eating his \"hasty\" words. The next day, he apologised profusely on Facebook for his \"discourtesy\", apparently after multiple calls from Chechnya. Cartoons of his sudden change of heart soon spread on social media, depicting him begging forgiveness with a gun to his head. In an ultimate humiliation, the shamefaced politician was seen in a video clip apologising personally to Ramzan for his \"emotional outburst\". Activists on Twitter then took up the Siberian's insult with the hashtag #KadyrovshameofRussia. Well-known opposition journalists followed that by filming themselves making fake, grovelling apologies to Ramzan \"for existing\". One was filmed running on a treadmill with no trousers, just as a young Chechen man was forced to do recently after criticising Ramzan Kadyrov on Instagram. Meanwhile, a group of prominent Russian liberals has begun gathering signatures demanding his resignation, and a St Petersburg politician has called on prosecutors to examine his statements for extremism. But the backlash has only increased the tirade from Chechnya, where local politicians have been falling over themselves to express devotion to their leader. None has outdone the speaker of parliament, Magomed Daudov, who posted a photograph of his boss holding back his huge, fierce dog on a leash and warned that Tarzan's teeth were \"itching\" - naming four well-known opposition figures whom the hound would presumably love to sink them into. \"Tarzan has become very frisky. We can barely restrain him,\" wrote the speaker in an Instagram post that attracted over 6,000 likes. \"Just imagine what would happen\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 If it weren't for\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Democracy.\" There is some talk that this is all a show of strength by the Chechen leader: a reminder of the considerable forces at his disposal amid talk of a power struggle between Grozny and Moscow. But the Kremlin has remained tight-lipped throughout, prompting others to conclude that it more likely endorses Ramzan's actions. Parliamentary elections are due later this year and, with an economy battered by falling oil prices, there's concern that opposition groups could capitalise on potential social unrest. \"It's a message to all of those who don't agree with what's happening,\" argues former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now an opposition activist in exile and himself one of the obvious targets of Ramzan Kadyrov's ire. \"The authorities are afraid and they decided to frighten society,\" wrote Mr Khodorkovsky on his blog. Another commentator has suggested that the Chechen leader simply wants to underline his loyalty to Moscow ahead of a wave of forced budget cuts and to ensure that the generous flow of federal subsidies to Chechnya does not stop. Whatever the motive, the practice of singling out traitors is seen as particularly dangerous in the wake of Boris Nemtsov's murder. A year ago, Putin loyalists were still beating the drum of patriotism following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine; state TV was lashing out viciously at Kremlin critics; warnings that Ukraine-style revolutions would not be tolerated were rife. Ramzan Kadyrov's latest outburst has resurrected the idea of an enemy within and the search for a scapegoat. \"The situation is very tense now,\" Mr Senchenko, explained by phone from Krasnoyarsk, pointing to Russia's mounting economic problems. That concern is what motivated his own Facebook rage against Chechnya's leader. \"Some people really think there are enemies of the state and it's not clear what can enter their heads,\" he warned.  \"So we need to be careful.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Traitors, jackals and vile liberals are just a few of the choice descriptions of Russia's opposition emerging from Chechnya in recent days, in a war of words that threatens to escalate.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Police commissioner K P Raghuvanshi said the builders were arrested for allegedly paying bribes to police and municipal officials to construct the building in the Mumbai suburb of Thane without any official sanction. Mr Raghuvanshi said on Sunday that the nine would be formally charged with culpable homicide and causing death by negligence, once the investigation into the accident had been completed. If convicted, they face sentences of up to life in prison. Most of the victims of the Thane collapse were poor daily wage earners working at the site, and their families.

One police official told the BBC that the collapse appeared to have been caused by the use of substandard building material.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Real Madrid striker appeared before a judge in Versailles after being held in custody overnight. His lawyer says he played \"no part\" in an alleged attempt to extort money from fellow French international Mathieu Valbuena. The two men reportedly had an exchange during a training session. According to French media, Mr Benzema mentioned the tape to the midfielder during a national team training session at Clairefontaine in early October. A source close to inquiry, quoted by told AFP news agency, said the 27-year-old star told investigators on Thursday he had approached Mr Valbuena about the tape on behalf of \"a childhood friend\". France coach Didier Deschamps left both players out of his squad selected on Thursday for matches against Germany and England later in November. The prosecutor's office earlier confirmed that Mr Benzema was now under formal investigation for complicity in attempted blackmail and participation in a criminal conspiracy. When a suspect is placed under formal investigation, he or she is then examined by a judge, who determines whether there is sufficient evidence for the suspect to be charged. If formal charges do follow and he is convicted, Mr Benzema could face a minimum jail sentence of five years, the prosecutor said. Meanwhile the court has banned the striker from contacting his France team-mate, or any other people charged in the case. Speaking to reporters after the ruling, Mr Benzema's lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, said his client was adamant he was not guilty of the charges. \"Karim Benzema has nothing to hide,\" he said. \"He supports his friend, Mathieu Valbuena, with all his heart. He took no part, I state this again - no part - in the blackmail or blackmail attempts.\" \"Karim Benzema will show he acted in good faith, and I hope this will be seen as soon as possible,\" Mr Cormier added. Whether or not the footballer is charged, correspondents say the formal investigation exposes him to a lengthy period of doubt ahead of the Euro 2016 tournament that France hosts next year. French coach Deschamps refused to comment on the legal case on Thursday but said Mr Benzema had been injured. He added that Lyon midfielder Mr Valbuena was not in an emotional state to play in upcoming games against Germany and England. Karim Benzema is the top scorer in the France team, so doubts about his participation at Euro 2016 represent a cloud over Les Bleus as they aim to make the most of their host status. The Real Madrid striker has scored 27 goals in 81 appearances for his country, more than double the number scored by fellow France striker Olivier Giroud, and apart from missing out at the 2010 World Cup, has been a mainstay in the team since making his debut in 2007. Benzema is regarded as one of Europe's top strikers, but despite winning honours at Real Madrid, he is yet to make a telling contribution at a major tournament for his country. Sources have told French media that a relative of Mr Benzema was contacted by the blackmailers, in an attempt to involve him in the scheme against his team-mate. There has been no confirmation from police. Three other men have been placed under formal investigation after Mr Valbuena was contacted by someone claiming to have the video. It is not the first time Mr Benzema has been involved in a police inquiry. Last year, he and fellow France international Franck Ribery were cleared of accusations they had slept with an under-age prostitute, who later went on to become a reality TV star and fashion designer.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "French footballer Karim Benzema has been placed under formal investigation in connection with a sex tape blackmail plot involving another player.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The IWF issued new measures before last year's Rio Olympics to crack down on doping in the sport. Its executive board decided \"national federations confirmed to have produced three or more anti-doping rule violations in the combined re-analysis process of the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games shall be suspended for one year\".

{"article": "###\nArticle: European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK may want to be more \"obliging\" to certain countries to secure future commercial advantages. The EU is keen to maintain a united front and conduct central negotiations. Meanwhile, a leading candidate to be France's next President says he will take a \"pretty tough\" line on Brexit. Emmanuel Macron, who opinion polls suggest could win May's election, told Channel 4 News the UK should not be punished for voting to leave the EU but the EU's interests had to be paramount into the upcoming negotiations. \"We have to preserve the rest of the European Union and not to convey the message that you can decide to leave without any consequence,\" he said. Official discussions on the terms of the UK's exit and its future relationship with the EU are expected to begin in the Spring once the UK has triggered Article 50 - notifying the union of its intention to leave. Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear that the UK will leave the EU's single market and wants bespoke commercial and customs agreements based on tariff-free and \"frictionless\" cross-border trade. She has also made clear that she is prepared to leave the EU without a formal deal rather sign up to a bad one. The final agreement on the UK's exit will need the approval of 20 out of the EU's 27 other member states as well as the support of the European Parliament. However, a future trade deal could need the backing of all EU states. There have been suggestions the UK could potentially exploit divisions within the EU over how hard a bargain they are willing to drive. Several EU leaders have insisted the UK cannot expect a better deal outside the EU than it has now and their priority is to protect the interests of the remaining 27 members. Others have advised against \"punishing\" the UK. Speaking after holding talks with Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, Mr Juncker said there would be no parallel negotiations and the UK would not be allowed to conduct bilateral discussions in key areas such as finance, telecommunications or chemicals. \"A situation could arise whereby the UK might attempt to or wish to be obliging to certain member states in certain economic zones and certain sectors whereby those countries might wish to provide certain advantages to the UK,\" he said. \"It is in our interests therefore that we don't have any special discussions... with certain individual countries.\" Mr Kern said that Europe would not \"capitulate\" to the UK by granting it a better status than it would enjoy if it was still an EU member. \"If you want to be a member of a club you have better conditions, obviously, than if you want to be outside the club,\" he said. The EU's negotiating team will be headed up by former commissioner Michel Barnier. Speaking during a visit to Finland his UK counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, said he wanted an outcome which was good for the EU as well as the UK. \"We're not talking about a break-up, we're talking about a new relationship, that's what we want to see,\" he said. The UK's former ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has said the negotiations - which are scheduled to be completed in two years - will be \"humungous\" in scope.

A European Commission spokesman said while progress was made at Sunday's talks \"significant gaps\" remained. Europe wants Greece to make spending cuts worth \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.44bn), to secure a deal that will unlock bailout funds. Greek bank stocks were hit hardest on Monday morning with Athens' Stock Exchange FTSE Banks Index falling 10%. National Bank of Greece fell 10.6% and Attica and Bank of Piraeus both plunged 12%. More widely shares across Europe were lower on heightened fears of a default and messy Greek exit from the eurozone in just over two weeks' time. Greece must repay more than \u20ac1.5bn of loans to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the end of the month and promise further economic reforms to receive around \u20ac7bn bailout funds, which have been delayed by three months amid growing fears the government has run out of money altogether. Sticking points between Greece and the IMF and EU remain reforms to VAT, pensions and a primary budget surplus target for this year and next year. Talks were reported to have broken up after just 45 minutes on Sunday. Greek deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis said that Athens was still ready to negotiate with its lenders. He said Greek government proposals submitted on Sunday had fully covered the fiscal deficit as demanded. But on Monday Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras warned Athens would stand its ground until its creditors become \"realistic\". \"We will wait patiently until the institutions become more realistic,\" Mr  Tsipras wrote in Greek national newspaper Ephimarida ton Syndakton adding that \"political opportunism\" was driving the creditors to keep pressing Athens to make cuts to pensions. He called on the IMF  and EU to \"meditate\" on the idea that: \"We are not only the heirs of a long history of struggle. We are also carrying on our shoulders the dignity of a people, and the hope of the peoples of Europe.\" Meanwhile on Monday, the president of Germany's central bank Jens Weidmann, warned Greece \"time was running out\" adding that it was now clearly up to the government in Athens to act.

The pilots' strike, called over a pay dispute, will affect around 100,000 passengers, Lufthansa said. The industrial action is part of a long-running pay dispute at Lufthansa. The pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) has organised 14 strikes since April 2014. Short and medium-haul flights from Germany will be affected from 00:01 to 23:59 local time (23:01-22:59 GMT). Flights by Lufthansa's other airlines including Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Air Dolomiti and Brussels Airlines are not affected by the strike, the airline said. Pay talks between the Vereinigung union and the German airline broke down earlier this month, and Lufthansa said the union had \"consistently rejected the offer\" of mediation. The union is calling for a 3.7% pay rise for 5,400 pilots dating back to 2012. Lufthansa, which is facing increasing competition from budget rivals, offered a 2.5% increase over the six years until 2019.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The leak happened at the Worthy Farm site in Somerset in June 2014 and damaged water quality and killed fish. Founder Michael Eavis, who was at Yeovil Magistrates' Court, said the sewage was in a \u00a3100,000 slurry tank. The Glastonbury Festival is one of the UK's biggest music events, with some 175,000 people attending each year. During the hearing, the judge was told that 42 fish were killed by the sewage after a \"large quantity\" of sewage filtered into Whitelake River. Sensors in the stream alerted the Environment Agency to increased ammonia levels. The court was told fish - including protected brown trout - died as a result. Glastonbury Festival 2014 admitted the single charge against it. Prosecuting, Kieran Martyn said: \"The impact was extensive... It extended for at least 4km downstream.\" Representing the festival, Kerry Gwyther, said the leak in the tank was a \"freak incident\" and not as serious as was being made out. \"We don't accept that it was a major incident as described by the agency,\" he said. \"The leak period was eight hours. We do accept that there was a significant effect on water quality and the fish health. \"Significant costs were not incurred in terms of a clean up.\" The case has now been adjourned while both parties put together more detailed background reports. Outside court Michael Eavis said: \"Of course, I'm exceedingly sorry for what's happened. \"We had a problem obviously - there were 200,000 people and we were storing slurry. \"It was a tank for holding farm slurry, but on this occasion we were using it for the festival sewage and it was starting to leak. \"It was a brand new build, it cost me \u00a3100,000, so that's my defence.\" Another issue yet to be decided is the seriousness of the breach. If it is a category one offence, the festival would be in line for a fine of between \u00a355,000 to \u00a3300,000 or, if it is deemed a category two the fine would be \u00a320,000. The defence team told the court any fine should be in line with the company's finances. They said the festival's net profit was \u00a384,000 a year before tax. But the prosecution said turnover was about \u00a337m. Mr Gwyther said the site donated \u00a32m in 2015 to a number of charities, including the Somerset Wildlife Trust and WaterAid. District Judge David Taylor said there was \"significant differences between one account to another\" and said there would be a four-day hearing to decide the facts before sentencing.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Its Green Budget, which looks at options and issues ahead of next month's Budget, says the UK's finances still have \"a long way to go\". To meet plans announced in last year's Autumn Statement departmental spending cuts of \u00a351.4bn, or 14.1%, are needed in the next parliament, the IFS said. Cuts in the current parliament are expected to reach \u00a338.3bn, or 9.5%. The IFS said that over the next four years the UK is planning the largest fiscal consolidation out of 32 advanced economies. It would mean public spending falling to its lowest share of national income since at least 1948, and fewer people working in the public sector than at any time since at least 1971. But the report is optimistic about UK growth, estimating zero inflation and 3% growth this year. Andrew Goodwin, senior economist at Oxford Economics and co-author of a chapter in the Green Budget, said: \"The prognosis for the UK economy is pretty upbeat\", and he predicted \"a big turnaround in household finances\" over the next year. The Green Budget said that spending cuts so far have been less than planned. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: \"Mr Osborne has perhaps not been quite such an austere Chancellor as either his own rhetoric or that of his critics might suggest. \"And he has cut departmental investment spending by only half as much as he originally planned. \"The public finances have a long way to go before they finally recover from the effects of the financial crisis. \"One result is that he or his successor will still have a lot of fiscal work to do over the course of the next parliament.\" The report said that the high deficit of more than 5% of national income, and total debt of more than 80% of income, is because of poor economic performance at the start of this parliament. But the coalition government has implemented fewer real spending cuts than originally planned, no net additional tax rises have been implemented, and tax revenues have risen slower than expected. There has been no real reduction in spending on social security as the number of pensioners and the generosity of the state pension has risen. The IFS's Green Budget starkly illustrates the central economic choice facing voters in May: bigger cuts with a Tory or Tory-led government; higher public sector debt with a Labour one. The contest stems from their differing approaches to balancing the books. The Tories want an overall surplus by 2018 and surpluses thereafter in all \"normal\" years; Labour wants balance only on the current budget - that's day-to-day spending, excluding investment - by 2020. The IFS has provided a useful numerical way of understanding Tories' and Labour's conflicting economic visions - which is essentially that the Conservatives believe the imperative is to cut debt and the size of the state, whereas Labour wants potentially bigger budgets for building roads, rail and schools, and for funding the police and prisons. Both parties promise to protect spending on health, education and overseas aid. Read Robert Peston in full here. The IFS said 98% of the remaining consolidation is currently planned to come from spending cuts rather than higher taxes. It says that the three main UK parties could all cut spending by less than is implied by Autumn Statement plans and still hit their fiscal targets. The Conservatives would need to reduce departmental spending after 2015/16 by 6.7% (\u00a324.9bn). And Labour and the Liberal Democrats would need to impose departmental spending cuts of 1.4% (\u00a35.2bn) and 2.1% (\u00a37.9bn) respectively to be consistent with their fiscal targets and stated intentions on tax and benefit policy. But if Labour plans were continued into the 2020s the reduction in total debt would be 9% of GDP, compared with 19% under the Conservatives' proposed overall budget balance.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said that the worst of the UK's spending cuts are still to come.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The 23-year-old Gloucester and Wales back row was part of an advanced guard of 14 players who met in the Vale of Glamorgan to start preparing for next month's daunting tour of New Zealand, which kicks off on 3 June. The rest of the 41-man squad are still involved in English Premiership, Pro12 or French play-offs, so coach Warren Gatland and his backroom staff have been putting the players who are available through their paces. For the 14 that boils down to exercise bikes at breakfast time; hard fitness, skills and organisation either side of lunch and community singing at supper time. Nobody said life with the Lions would be champagne and roses. Asked how his introduction to Lions rugby has been, Moriarty laughs: \"Is this on the record?\" Then he puts his game face on, or at least the one players wear when facing the media. \"It's been good. The fitness is obviously a big element of this week,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device \"We start on the bikes at 7.30, which isn't fun, but hard work pays off in the end and the training sessions have been intense with a lot of running fitness and skills and combined with some more organisational stuff, so it's been a good mixture. \"It's a step up. Everybody steps up a level whatever they are doing. Everyone's going to be pushing harder than in the past. \"The Lions comes around every four years and some people only get one chance and no one is going to be holding anything back, that's for sure. \"It's tough. You get to know new systems and line-outs and that's got to happen pretty quickly. \"We're playing in a couple of weeks' time and we're going to be hitting the ground running when we get to the first game. \"You push yourself to the very edge and then you make rugby easier.\" Moriarty was one of the surprise selections when Gatland's squad was announced in April after his emergence for Wales and impressive form for Gloucester. He described hearing his name called out as overwhelming, but having played in all three Tests for Wales against the All Blacks in June 2016 knows exactly what to expect in New Zealand. \"It's going to be a huge challenge,\" he added. \"It's 10 games with three Tests in there and we know every single game is going to be as big as the next. \"Leading up to those Tests everybody's going to be laying everything out and putting the best foot forward and everyone's going to be fighting each other for that Test shirt.\" The inevitable competition for places has to be contained within a team built from four countries and players used to battling against each other on the international field. So the fledgling Lions have been learning to sing from the same song sheet - literally. Moriarty has had a familiar room-mate in the shape of Gloucester and Scotland scrum-half Greig Laidlaw, who has been setting the standard in the vocal stakes. \"I'm not too good at singing, but I'll have a go, as in all things,\" said Moriarty. \"Greig's enjoying himself singing the Scottish songs, and everyone's getting into it and it's good fun. \"In the evenings we have a get together and we have our song sheets and you'll get to hear it in the next few weeks, but we'll do our best on them as well.\" What will they sing?

In a motion in the House of Commons, he will call for a \"new political consensus\" on education policy. \"We have a long-standing mismatch between the education system and the labour market,\" says Mr Hunt. Mr Hunt is understood to want a more \"constructive\" approach to opposition after Labour's general election defeat. The motion in the House of Commons will emphasise the common goals of wanting to improve education to drive economic growth and calls on the government to create a cross-party review \"to cover exams, educational institutions and curriculum\". Mr Hunt wants to build a political consensus on moving away from the current GCSE system, which he argues needs to be overhauled when the leaving age has risen to 18 and these are no longer the final school-leaving exams. The shadow education secretary wants a broader baccalaureate system incorporating both vocational and academic exams. But such a change would need to be introduced over a longer period than the next Parliament - and Mr Hunt's move is an attempt to \"begin a conversation\". Mr Hunt says that the exams system is no longer delivering the skills needed for the labour market. \"We need a new political consensus to put it right. That is why I am calling on the government to initiate a cross-party review of 14-19 education in this country. \"We should leave nothing off the table. Our only goal should be establishing consensus on the changes needed in our 14-19 education system to secure for our country the long-term economic growth and productivity that we need to succeed.\" Education Secretary Nicky Morgan promised during the election campaign there would be no more \"constant upheaval or constant change\" in the next five years. The major changes to the exam system and curriculum, announced in the previous coalition government, will be implemented during the next Parliament. These include phasing in a more \"rigorous\" set of GCSEs and A-levels, with less coursework and modules and a greater emphasis on exams at the end of two years.

About 21 million refugees have been forced to flee their countries due to conflict or persecution, the UN says. Nine million people alone have been displaced by the six-year conflict in Syria while more than four million others have fled the war-torn country. \"We cannot avert our eyes or turn our backs. To slam the door in the face of these families would betray our deepest values,\" he added. The US has agreed to take in 110,000 new refugees in the 2017 fiscal year - which begins on 1 October- compared with the 85,000 refugees it expects by the end of September. The president's remarks come a day after a US and Russia-brokered ceasefire unravelled, partly due to a US-led air strike over the weekend that mistakenly killed Syrian soldiers. Tensions continued on Monday when a strike, which witnesses say came from the air, hit an aid convoy at Urum al-Kubra, destroying 18 UN lorries and killing about 20 civilians. The UN has since suspended all aid convoys to Syria in response. Both Russia and Syria have insisted their forces were not behind the strike. The president's announcement also included a pledge by countries to increase financial contributions to UN appeals and humanitarian groups by about $4.5b (\u00c2\u00a33.5b) over 2015 levels. Participating countries have vowed to help fund schools for a million refugee children as well as assist in helping one million refugees work legally. Mr Obama used his eighth and final UN address as president to call for a \"course correction\" to ensure that extremism and violence does not drive countries into a more divided world. \"Together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home,\" he said. Though he made no direct mention of the US, Mr Obama said wealthy countries with the resources should do more to help. In what appeared to be a dig at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, he added: \"The world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent (extremism) from affecting our own societies.\" Hours earlier, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also expressed concern over the conflict in Syria, saying there was \"no military solution\". \"Gulfs of mistrust divide citizens from their leaders.

They are thought to be from a Quaker burial ground that existed before the Royal Pavilion Estate was built. Alan Robins, chair of Brighton and Hove City Council's tourism, development and culture committee said: \"The remains are now being carefully exhumed and will be examined to determine more about the deceased before being re-buried or cremated.\" He added the Royal Pavilion Estate site had \"so many strong historic links\" and the find is \"another important addition to the city's rich cultural story\". Darryl Palmer of Archaeology South-East, which is managing the dig on site, said: \"This is a significant find that shines a light on an important historical moment in the city. The Quaker meeting house and cemetery at the Dome is recorded on the Bishop's map of 1803 and absent by the OS town plan of 1876. \"The best clue as to when worship and burial ceased is when the Quaker meeting house moved to the current location on Meeting House Lane in 1805.\" A spokesperson for Brighton Quakers said they were \"excited\" with the news \"We have known for a long time about the burial ground being used from 1700 to 1805 but did not know that any Quakers were left buried there.\" The work at the Corn Exchange is part of a project to restore the Royal Pavilion Estate buildings and gardens.

Most of the activists were members of the predominantly Catholic dissident group, Ladies in White.

According to Cuba's main dissident website, 14yMedio, members of Ladies in White and activists from other opposition groups were handcuffed and pushed into police cars and buses on Sunday afternoon. A number of them were released hours later, it said. Cuba says the protesters are financed by right-wing American groups to destabilise the government. Cuban dissidents are planning to protest during the Pope's visit to the island, which begins on Saturday. They have accused the Cuban Catholic Church of becoming too cosy with the government of Raul Castro and failing to speak out against human rights abuses. \"The Church should be concerned about this or any time human rights are involved. It's their duty,\" said Jose Daniel Ferrer, head of leading dissident group Patriotic Union of Cuba. He told the Reuters news agency he was handcuffed and taken to a police station after Sunday's protest. Police later dropped him off at a bus terminal, he said. The Cuban Catholic Church says it defends the respect of human rights but cannot take up individual political causes. Pope Francis played a key role in facilitating the historic negotiations between Cuba and the United States, which led to diplomatic relations being restored after more than five decades of hostilities.

In all the cases, two or three men have targeted foreign national tourists in an attempt to steal money - succeeding on two occasions. The men, who are described as southern European, claimed to be police officers before demanding to search the victims. Police Scotland said the first incident took place at about 13:20 on 3 February in the Grassmarket, when a Chilean man was approached by a man who asked him to take his photograph. The pair were then approached by two suspects who claimed to be police officers and then demanded to search them. The two police impersonators then got into a silver or grey Seat hatchback and drove away and the other man walked into the Grassmarket. Officers said the Chilean man later realised a three-figure sum of money had been stolen from him. On 13 February, two Chinese tourists lost a four-figure sum of cash when they were targeted in a similar scam on Market Street. They were approached by two men who showed them ID and said they were undercover police officers. Other incidents happened in Chambers Street, Castle Street, and in the Calton Hill area.

Ms Malmstrom was speaking as EU trade ministers met in Slovakia to discuss CETA and a similar deal with the US, TTIP, which has also faced criticism. A draft CETA deal has been agreed, but parliaments could still delay it. Thousands of activists protested against CETA and TTIP in Germany on Saturday and thousands more in Brussels - outside the EU's headquarters - on Tuesday. Activists fear that the deals could water down European standards in the key areas of workers' rights, public health and the environment. There is also great anxiety about proposed special courts where investors will be able to sue governments if they feel that legislation hurts their business unfairly. Critics say the mere existence of such courts - an alternative to national courts - will have a \"chilling\" effect on policymakers, leading to slacker regulation on the environment and welfare. Would CETA be a good model for the UK? European Parliament briefing on CETA TTIP: The EU-US trade deal explained Are US-Europe TTIP trade talks tanking? Ms Malmstrom said CETA would dominate Friday's meeting in Bratislava. The Commission hopes the deal can be signed with Canada at the end of October, so that it can then go to the European Parliament for ratification. But it will also need to be ratified by national parliaments across the EU. \"What we are discussing with the Canadians is if we should make some clarifications, a declaration so that we can cover some of those concerns,\" Ms Malmstrom said. She acknowledged fears in some countries that politicians might see their \"the right to regulate\" diluted. \"Maybe that [right] needs to be even clearer in a declaration,\" she said, admitting that the CETA negotiations were still \"difficult\". Karoline Graswander-Hainz, an Austrian Socialist MEP, said the EU's top court - the European Court of Justice - must first examine the proposed Investment Court System (ICS) to check its legality. CETA holds \"great risks\" for Europe, she warned, adding that some of her fellow MEPs thought likewise. German Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel called CETA \"a model for future deals\". But he was pessimistic about TTIP. \"The Americans were not prepared to make Europe offers that Canada made, and so there will definitely not be a [TTIP] deal this year,\" he said. Supporters of CETA and TTIP say such deals could set global trade standards, warning that failure could mean China setting the standards.

{"article": "###\nArticle: One former worker told BBC Two's Newsnight that staff were told of complaints about a client who sexually exploited girls he met there, off site. But she says these concerns were not passed on and Newsnight has established that authorities were not alerted. The charity said it would have told police of any allegation it knew about. Two witnesses allege complaints were made known to staff at the charity's Urban Academy in Southwark, south-east London, which provides educational support to over-16s with \"complex emotional or behavioural needs\". The charity's chairman, Alan Yentob, who is also the BBC's creative director, said: \"There is no evidence that we were informed about a sexual abuse case. I think this amount of rumour and allegation and counter-allegation\u2026 is disgraceful.\" Before it shut its doors on Wednesday, Kids Company provided practical, emotional and educational support to some of the most deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people in London, Liverpool and Bristol. The charity, founded in 1996 by Camila Batmanghelidjh, was well known for its famous and wealthy supporters who included David Cameron, but has been closed amid a row over funding. In addition to the allegations being made to Newsnight, a former client of the charity has told BBC News that, when she was 16, she was touched inappropriately by a 24-year-old man who was also a client of the charity at that time. She said she attempted to tell a teacher at the charity, which provides educational services, but the conversation was stopped before she could explain she had been assaulted. Kate (not her her real name) said the sexual assaults took place over a period of seven months in 2009, and occurred at one Kids Company site. \"He would touch me in inappropriate places,\" she said. \"He would have his dirty comments like how he would like to do certain things. I got pushed to the wall once as well when he threatened me and said that if I didn't comply to his wishes then he would get me.\" Kate explained what happened when she tried to tell a teacher working at the charity what she had been going through. She said she telephoned the teacher and opened the conversation with an explanation that she was being harassed, but the teacher ended the conversation and put the phone down before she could mention the sexual assault allegations. Kate explained that some of those attending Kids Company with her were not \"kids\" but men in their 20s. \"Everyone was way older, they are all adult, not kids, they shouldn't be there. I was intimidated anyway, I felt intimidated by these men,\" she said. Responding to Kate's claim, Ms Batmanghelidjh said: \"I would be very concerned if a staff member turned round and said they can't do anything about it. \"I'd be very surprised and if a staff member, one staff member, had done that there were lots of others to go to.\" Kids Company employs 600 paid staff, as well as working with a pool of about 8,000 volunteers and 500 students. One woman who was a paid employee of the charity in 2009 claimed she was the victim of a sexual assault by a co-worker on a night out. Ella (not her real name) said the man forced his hand into her underwear and had to be pulled away by people around them. She said she reported the incident to the charity, but it was never dealt with properly. Ella said she was promised the accused co-worker would be kept away from Kids Company until Ms Batmanghelidjh had spoken to him, but the next day he was back on site. In emails seen by the BBC, Camilla Batmanghelidjh wrote to Ella: \"In relation to ******** and the police, that I would support you 100% and that in this situation you were my priority.\" However, she also questioned the woman's boundaries, writing: \"I'm not excusing *********'s behaviour or saying that your behaviour led to it. I'm merely asking you to be much, much clearer about establishing robust boundaries.\" Ella said she felt scared that little had been done - and that the man had not been suspended and continued to work at Kids Company. Ella herself reported the sexual assault allegation to police, but chose not to press charges. In the Newsnight investigation, it heard that male clients of the charity's Urban Academy in their 20s had forced young clients - girls aged 16 to 18 - to have sex with them. Referring to one such man, a former employee said: \"There'd be repercussions if they didn't\u2026 you have to do it, he'd blackmail them.\" She said the girls were told: \"If you don't do it I'll tell them about this, this, this and this. Or [he would] photograph them naked and then threaten to send it around to other people.\" This employee claims that these allegations had been raised with staff, and she knew of them herself, but said they were not passed on. Newsnight has confirmed that the allegations of coerced sex made by witnesses to the programme were not known to the authorities. A week ago, the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into Kids Company led by Scotland Yard's child abuse command. Camila Batmanghelidjh has emphatically denied any wrongdoing. She told BBC News: \"We've already had lawyers go through the details. \"There isn't an allegation that will stand. I'm telling you.  Now.  In 19 years we haven't had a single Child Protection problem in the organisation.   And whenever something is raised with us we immediately report it to the police. \" Speaking to Newsnight later, Ms Batmanghelidjh said the allegations of sexual exploitation by Kids Company clients of other clients were brought to the charity's notice for the first time by police recently. She added: \"If such a thing had taken place on our premises it would have triggered all our safeguarding procedures. I have absolutely no awareness of it. \"And there is no awareness of this incident having taken place at Kids Company premises or brought to Kids Company's attention.

He will still use a BMW 5 series car he inherited from the previous mayor, reports the IOL website.

Twenty years ago on Tuesday, Bosman emerged from the European Court of Justice with a win that turned Europe's top divisions into glorious expressions of multiculturalism and added a new noun to sport's lexicon: the Bosman. From that moment, players at the end of their contracts - David Beckham, Sol Campbell, Steve McManaman and many more - could move without a transfer fee. No longer would a player from the European Union have their opportunities in the single market curtailed by rules limiting the number of foreigners clubs could field. But for this softly spoken 51 year old, it was a case that almost ruined him. \"There have been real problems but I am feeling much better now,\" said Bosman when I asked him how he was after a spell in prison, bankruptcy and a long battle with alcoholism. \"I've had medical and psychological care and I also have blood samples taken on a regular basis. \"There have been difficulties and my financial situation is not easy but life has started over. I have regained strength and feel motivated. \"It has not been easy to find work after the ruling but I am not complaining. The tunnel is nearing its end.\" He entered that tunnel in 1990 when his contract with RFC Liege expired. With the club in financial trouble they wanted the midfielder to sign a new deal on a quarter of his former salary. Yet when Dunkerque, across the border in France, wanted to buy him, Liege demanded four times what they'd paid for him in the first place. \"It was illogical,\" said Bosman, explaining the moment he decided to become a \"freedom fighter\". His lawyer thought it would take two weeks. It took five years; a period that should have been the best years of a decent career. Banned in Belgium, Bosman moved to a second division club in France, only for them to go bust. Other clubs told him they would like to sign him but could not because they already had three foreigners. He had a brief spell on the island of La Reunion and another go in the Belgian leagues, but it is an understatement to say his decision to take football's business model to court made him less attractive to club chairmen. Broke, tired and out of shape, he accepted 350,000 Swiss francs in damages for his legal victory and began a life after football that he is still trying to work out. There was a disastrous investment in a t-shirt business (he had hoped grateful footballers would buy one, only his lawyer's son did so) and problems with the taxman. In 2011, he was convicted of assault following claims he had been involved in an argument with his girlfriend after he asked her daughter to get him some booze.  Initially, the courts were lenient but when he failed to pay his fine they were left with little choice. He was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013. It was then that Fifpro, the international trade union for footballers, stepped in. The stars he had helped become multi-millionaires may have forgotten him but his union did not. \"I was young and handsome then and I now have become old,\" he explained. \"Most of the players won't be able to recognise me but my case is still being talked about - I think that is positive. \"I may not be here in 20 years' time but they will still be talking about it and if someone remembers me I will give him my bank details. Everyone benefited from the Bosman ruling except me!\" I am speaking to him at Fifpro's swish headquarters in a suburb of Amsterdam. Bosman has become a spokesman for the organisation's campaign to finish what he started: scrap transfer fees entirely. The best way to understand this is to view Bosman as a battle in a 125-year war between clubs and players. The players won Bosman but were \"ambushed\", in the words of Fifpro's general secretary Theo van Seggelen, six years later. The European Commission made a deal with the game's governing bodies, Uefa and Fifa, to stem what the clubs claimed was rampant \"player power\". This deal was enshrined in Fifa's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players in 2001. These rules set out today's transfer system - windows - the concept of a protected period when a contract cannot be broken, maximum and minimum contract lengths and so on - and for Fifpro they amount to the pendulum swinging towards the clubs. Five years later, a row about Scottish defender Andy Webster's move from Hearts to Wigan Athletic saw that pendulum swing back. The details of the case are convoluted but the final ruling seemed to fix what compensation a player/new employer should pay the old employer for breaking a contract outside of the protected period. This sum would be the wages the player would earn if he stayed. This really could have been revolutionary but two years later the Court of Arbitration for Sport changed the compensation equation by adding pro rata slices of the initial transfer fee and an estimate of the player's replacement cost. Players such Andrea Pirlo or Robert Lewandowski could still let their contracts expire to get Bosman moves to new teams and bigger wages. But clubs wanting to sign players still under contract, even outside the protected period, would have to cough up some compensation, as Manchester City did with Raheem Sterling last summer. Quite right too, is the usual response to this compromise between a player's right to ply his trade on the one hand, and a club's right to stability and a league's competitive integrity on the other. Everton manager Roberto Martinez, the first Spanish player to get a Bosman to England, has criticised the transfer window, but does not want to scrap compensation. \"The Bosman ruling was a huge shock at the time but I used it and it now seems a normal way to move freely,\" said Martinez last week. \"Football has benefited from the multicultural input of players and it seems normal now. \"But it wouldn't be right to scrap transfer fees. The value of a footballer is important and the value of developing players is important.\" But Fifpro's Van Seggelen says this view is based on a misunderstanding of the players' position, as well as being unfounded in truth. Dr Stefan Szymanski, author of the best-selling Soccernomics and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, did some research for Fifpro earlier this year which outlined how the system was failing to do any of the things it promised in 2001. According to Szymanski, the settlement has led to the rich clubs getting richer as more than half of all transfer spending circulates among them, with little trickling down the pyramid, far less than is syphoned off by agents. He also outlined how the same clubs and leagues keep winning, while the same types of clubs and leagues keep failing, leaving themselves, he says, vulnerable to match-fixing, third-party ownership and the trafficking of minors. \"We thought the transfer system was finished on 15 December, 1995, but of course it isn't,\" explained Van Seggelen. \"In fact, the situation is even worse than before. I often say to people 'how would you feel if you had to wait three months for your salary?' \"You also have players waiting years for justice through the tribunal system, and even when he has a positive decision there is no enforcement system. We cannot accept that.\" That might win over a few more voters on the terraces but there will still be many in the \"Bosman ruined football\" camp who think this is simply a union fighting for more money for its members, and in this case the members are loaded. \"Only 1% of our members are financially independent, so not every player is making that kind of money,\" said Van Seggelen. \"We're not trying to make them richer. In an ideal world, every player would play at the level they belong. \"I don't know why the clubs are so nervous. We are not trying to kill the top clubs or leagues. \"Sport is unusual but it must be reasonable. It's an economic activity, a business, so it must respect the law.\" By this point, Bosman is outside smoking. Despite arriving late and looking like he could not wait for the interview to end, he was good company. He does not watch much football these days, he cannot afford the television subscriptions, but what he sees he enjoys. His main focus is looking after his two young boys and being a better dad to the grown-up daughter he has from an earlier relationship. \"Martin and Samuel are too young to know about my case, I don't want to complicate their lives with it, they've just left kindergarten,\" he said. \"But I think later, when they grow up, they could find out about what their dad has done for professional players on the internet and they will see their dad has done something good. \"Back then clubs were selling hens, horses, mules and pigs, but not humans. \"Players should be considered as workers, full stop, that's it! This is the Bosman ruling, and we ought to get back to it.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A Cruyff turn, Fergie time, the Matthews final: football's icons have often entered the language of the sport but can any of those greats claim to have changed the game as much as the nervous, middle-aged Belgian sitting in front of me?", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

But Wolves, who are unbeaten in the league at home in 10 matches, came on strong late on with Bodvarsson wasting a free header from 10 yards, and Joe Mason poking wide from close range. Miller's equaliser was the first time a visiting side had scored from open play at Molineux since February and left Burton 14th in the table, while Wolves dropped to 11th. Wolves' manager Walter Zenga: \"I'm feeling good because the team played good, especially in the second half. \"We deserved to win the game without a doubt but we have to understand we can't give them one chance like this in the last minute of the game. \"Perhaps in the first half the quality wasn't there as we had hoped but then in my opinion the quality showed, we played some nice football. \"It is true sometimes that too much change can create confusion but if you work it the right way, change means you have a fresh team all the time.\" Burton manager Nigel Clough: \"It was a bit frustrating that we had to wait until the 95th minute but it does feel like a win when you get a result so late in the day. \"I thought for long spells of the game that we were the ones who were creating the chances and looked the more likely to take the lead. \"Had we scored the penalty you never know it might have been a different story. \"It was only in the last 20 minutes when Wolves stepped it up a little bit and had chances. Apart from that we were comfortable. \"We are going to have a go this season. We will not sit back. We will try and take the game to teams and I think that has been evident in the first six games.\" Match ends, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1, Burton Albion 1.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The central bank voted unanimously to raise the key rate to a range of 0.5% to 0.75%, citing a stronger economic growth and rising employment. But the central bank said it expected the economy to need only \"gradual\" increases in the short term. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said the economic outlook was \"highly uncertain\" and the rise was only a \"modest shift\". However, the new Donald Trump administration could mean rates having to rise at a faster pace next year, she signalled at a news conference after the announcement. The president-elect has promised policies to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation. A US rate rise - how am I affected? US rate rise: Should Asia worry? Ms Yellen said it was wrong to speculate on Mr Trump's economic strategy without more details. But she added that some members of the Federal Open Markets Committee, the body which sets rates, have factored in to their forecasts an increase in spending. As a consequence, the FOMC said it now expects three rate rises next year rather than the two that were predicted in September. Ms Yellen told the news conference: \"We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty... All the FOMC participants recognise that there is considerable uncertainty about how economic policy may change and what effect they may have on the economy.\" Also, she declined to be drawn on Mr Trump's public comments about the Fed, and his use of tweets to announce policy and criticise companies. \"I'm a strong believer in the independence of the Fed,\" she told journalists. \"I am not going to offer the incoming president advice.\" The interest rate move had been widely expected, and followed the last increase a year ago. Rates have been near zero since the global financial crisis. But the US economy is recovering, underlined by recent data on consumer confidence, jobs, house prices and growth in manufacturing and services. Ms Yellen said the rate rise \"should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress that the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue\". Although inflation is still below the Fed's 2% target, it expects the rise in prices to pick up gradually over the medium term. \"The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\" the Fed statement said. It added: \"The federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\" The Fed also published its economic forecasts for the next three years. These suggest that the Federal Funds rate may rise to 1.4% next year; 2.1% in 2018; and 2.9% in 2019. GDP growth will rise to 2.1% next year and stay there, more or less, during those years. The unemployment rate will fall to 4.5% over the 2017-2019 period, the Fed forecast. And inflation will rise to 1.9% next year and hover at that level for the next two years. The dollar rose 0.5% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac0.9455, and was 0.9% higher against the yen at 116.17 yen. Wall Street's main stock markets were largely unmoved immediately after the Fed's announcement, but drifted lower later. The Dows Jones index closed down 0.6%, and the S&P 500 was 0.8% lower. There's a name missing from the Federal Reserve's statement - Donald Trump. The president-elect's surprise triumph at the polls last month has turned out to be a short term boost to the US economy. Stock markets have surged higher, and consumer confidence indicators show US consumers feeling even more upbeat. The challenge for the Fed is working out what his election may mean to the economy in the next year or so. The most obvious likely impact could come from tax cuts which both he and the Republican Congress seem to favour. Less certain is an infrastructure spending spree that Mr Trump would evidently like, but which many in Congress are less keen on. If Janet Yellen and her colleagues considered these political issues, they weren't mentioned in the official statement on monetary policy. Nevertheless Mr Trump has a way of breaking in to most conversations these days. And the first question asked of Ms Yellen at her press conference duly concerned America's next president - and she admitted that Mr Trump's impact on US tax and spending policies might have influenced some of her colleagues forecasts for next year.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The US Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, only the second increase in a decade.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Flint Community Hospital could be closed under plans by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) to reorganise its services in north Wales. Campaigners joined a protest march from the hospital to attend the public meeting at the town hall. In a statement BCUHB said retaining the status quo was \"not an option\". The health board, which predicts a financial shortfall of \u00c2\u00a364.6m this year, revealed details of its proposed shake-up in July. Under plans being considered Blaenau Ffestiniog community hospital could also close and minor injury accident departments may shut at other locations. Neo-natal intensive care may also be transferred over the border to England as part of the proposed shake-up. Shortly after the plans were made public GPs in the area revealed their concerns about the effects of proposed cuts on community services. Mark Scriven, the health board's medical director, said there was sound reasoning behind the proposals to close Flint hospital. \"The thinking generally about the problems we're trying to address in these proposals with community hospitals is that some of them are very old, and they have poor fabric,\" he told BBC Radio Wales. He said it was not just the furnishings that were not up to scratch, the physical space did not suit modern health care. \"A lot of them, and the services they provide, are underused, and certainly the minor injuries unit at Flint hospital is underused, which is important because it doesn't allow the nurses running it to maintain their experience according to their professional bodies,\" added Mr Scriven. In response, Jack Reece, chairman of the Save Our Cottage Hospital Campaign, said Flint hospital was well used. Speaking at Tuesday protest, he added: \"They've closed us, they took beds away from us. We've had 18 going down to 14, going down to 12, 10. \"They're taking away our clinics from there. They have systematically dropped the services from this town.\" Mr Reece described BCUHB's plans as a new version of old proposals by the Flintshire Health Board which had already been rejected by the Welsh government. Explaining the reasons behind its proposed shake-up, BCUHB said it was clear that it could not afford to stand still. \"The status quo is not an option,\" the board said. \"The proposals we are now making are intended to change the way in which services are provided and where they are provided to ensure patient safety and meet quality standards. \"The proposals will allow us to attract and retain the professional clinical staff we need and control our costs when public finances are decreasing.\" BCUHB said its consultation exercise would run until 28 October, and it would also take account of the views of the community health council and any views they have heard from the public before making decisions. Any changes would start in early 2013, it said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "More than 1,000 campaigners trying to save a north Wales community hospital from closure have marched to a health board consultation meeting.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The bill promises new powers for Wales, but there have been claims it would reduce AMs law-making powers. First Minister Carwyn Jones recommended AMs vote for the bill, saying it could be improved but \"takes Wales forward\". But Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood suggested Wales had been \"backed into a corner\" over the legislation. The vote was 38-17 in favour of the bill. The Wales Bill offers to extend the transfer of powers over tax, energy, transport and the assembly's own affairs. Labour - the largest group with 29 of the 60 assembly seats - agreed on Monday to back the legislation despite reservations. It was joined in supporting the bill by the Conservatives, ensuring the motion to give consent to the bill passed. UKIP and Plaid Cymru opposed the law - UKIP voted against because it devolved income tax without a referendum and Plaid because of the claimed \"roll-back\" in assembly powers. The Wales Bill introduces a system of powers that are reserved to Westminster - such as defence and foreign affairs - with everything else assumed to be devolved. But some have claimed that the new devolution model is unclear and have criticised the large list of reservations. In a debate on the bill in the Senedd, the first minister said: \"On balance, I believe it is in the best interests of Wales as we look at dealing with the issue of Brexit that we take what is on offer today.\" Mr Jones said the bill should be seen as \"another step on what is a long journey of devolution\". However he said there was \"a need for improvement\" in some areas, such as the lack of devolution of air passenger duty. He added it was \"not possible to conclude that the reserved powers model, welcome though it is in theory, is fit for purpose in the long term\". \"There is no other country that I know of where two legislatures exist in the same jurisdiction\", he said. \"It's possible in the future that somebody might be arrested in Cardiff for something that is not an offence in Wales.\" Plaid Cymru decided at a group meeting on Tuesday to oppose the bill. Sian Gwenllian, Simon Thomas and Elin Jones voted in favour, with the rest of the group against. Ms Wood told the debate Plaid was voting against the Wales Bill \"with a heavy heart\". \"We never want to see Wales backed into a corner again,\" she said. Her party supported the fiscal framework on Wales' funding negotiated between the UK and Welsh governments, she said. But she added: \"The UK Government did not have to tie the fiscal framework to a bill that would restrict our ability to make laws. \"The public finances of Wales should not be conditional on accepting a worsened legislative framework.\" Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"Is any bill perfect? No it's not. \"But this bill offers a huge opportunity to take responsibility over energy, over transport, over electoral arrangements, over income tax - the list goes on.\" He said it was a \"sad day when Plaid Cymru in this chamber choose to vote against... [an] opportunity for a huge transfer of responsibility and sovereignty\". UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton told the Senedd he supported the broad principles of the Wales Bill. But he said the removal of the need for a referendum before income tax powers were devolved was a \"constitutional deficiency we ought not to ignore\". He said it was an \"important principle that politicians should keep their promises and should be held to their word\". Mark Reckless, UKIP AM for South Wales East, added: \"They know if they did have a referendum they would lose.\" Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Davies said the Welsh devolution settlement would need a rethink because of Brexit. It is the fourth Wales Bill since the devolution process began in 1998 with the act which created the assembly. Mr Davies said powers returned to the UK by the European Union after Brexit would require more legislation \"to realign those responsibilities\". \"This will not be the last Wales Bill, but it will be the last Wales Bill in this parliamentary session\", he added. Mr Davies also regretted the UK government's decision not to devolve powers over air passenger duty. He said he thought it would be devolved eventually as there was \"no coherent argument to hold it back\". What is in the Wales Bill? Under a political convention between the assembly and Westminster, the Wales Bill needed a legislative consent motion passed in the Senedd before it can be become law. That is because the Wales Bill relates to devolved matters. The convention does not have legal force but Wales Office minister Lord Bourne has said the bill would not become law if the assembly did not approve it. The vote means the bill will now return to Parliament for the final stages of the legislative process.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "AMs have backed the UK Government's Wales Bill in a Senedd vote - meaning the next stage of devolution can become law.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection.  I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet.

For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it's about time that we start to live like real people. Twitter: Nawara Negm I'm not writing my blog right now.  We're just using Twitter as it's easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square. The internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people's anger. In the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we're trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It's like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution. Blog: MaLek X (in Arabic) The revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn't think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I'm sure that those who named the date didn't think things would go this far. To begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard. After our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died. Still the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we're collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: \"We're really proud of you... You did what we didn't manage to do for 60 years.\" People have called this the \"Facebook Revolution\" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked. In the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I've been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don't know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to. We're finally getting to know each other. It's wonderful.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Egypt's internet activists have played a key role in the pro-democracy protests from the outset, but they tell the BBC that the online campaigning is evolving to suit their real-life activism in Tahrir Square.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The verdict triggered alarm, with some saying that science itself had been put on trial. On Monday an appeals court cleared the group of the manslaughter charges. Judge Fabrizia Ida Francabandera ruled that there was no case to answer. \"The credibility of Italy's entire scientific community has been restored,\" said Stefano Gresta, the president of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology. The seven men - all leading scientists or disaster experts - had been members of a committee convened in L'Aquila in March 2009 following a series of tremors in the region. Days after they met, a 6.3 magnitude quake struck the town in the middle of the night. Many of L'Aquila's medieval buildings were destroyed, and some locals blamed the disaster committee for not providing adequate advice. Prosecutors in the subsequent trial said the experts had offered falsely reassuring information to residents. According to Reuters, they noted that one committee member had said there was \"no danger\" from the tremors. Following the guilty verdicts, more than 5,000 scientists signed an open letter to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano in support of the experts. Many argued that the convictions represented a fundamental misunderstanding of earthquake science. Monday's decision to overturn the verdicts came after a month-long appeal process.

{"article": "###\nArticle: US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that can kill and eat harmful bugs. The study, in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, could lead to a \"major change in treatment\", a UK expert said. B3 was tested on Staphylococcal infections, such as the potentially fatal MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Such infections are found in hospitals and nursing homes, but are also on the rise in prisons, the military and among athletes. The scientists used extremely high doses of B3 - far higher than that obtained from dietary sources - in their tests, carried out both on animals and on human blood. And the researchers say there is as yet no evidence that dietary B3 or supplements could prevent or treat bacterial infections. The researchers say B3 appears to be able to \"turn on\" certain antimicrobial genes, boosting the immune cells' killing power. Prof Adrian Gombart, of Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Institute, who worked on the research, said: \"This is potentially very significant, although we still need to do human studies. \"Antibiotics are wonder drugs, but they face increasing problems with resistance by various types of bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus. \"This could give us a new way to treat Staph infections that can be deadly, and might be used in combination with current antibiotics. \"It's a way to tap into the power of the innate immune system and stimulate it to provide a more powerful and natural immune response.\" Prof Mark Enright, of the University of Bath, said: \"Neutrophils  are really the front line against infections in the blood and the use of nicotinamide seems safe at this dose to use in patients as it is already licensed for use. \"This could cause a major change in treatment for infections alongside conventional antibiotics to help bolster patients immune system. \"I would like to see in patient clinical trials but cannot see why this couldn't be used straight away in infected patients.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Vitamin B3 could be the new weapon in the fight against superbugs such as MRSA, researchers have suggested.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The review into 22 abuse cases in Northern Ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough. The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while being looked after in the care system. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe. In September 2013, the PSNI said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in Northern Ireland. Officers said they had identified 22 people, aged between 13 and 18, who may have been sexually exploited. The PSNI investigation was known was Operation Owl. Thursday's report, examining the PSNI response, has been published by the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland. It said PSNI officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system. However, it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review - \"limited and inconsistent\". While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes, Stormont's Health Minister Simon Hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm. He said the review had identified \"a significant gap\" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, Det Ch Supt George Clarke said that following Operation Owl, the PSNI has \"implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe\". \"Indeed, in April of this year, the PSNI formed the Public Protection Branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation. \"The new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people.\" The office said the PSNI has also revised its Missing Persons Protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities. \"This protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the PSNI and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,\" Mr Clarke added. Last year, a separate review into the issue concluded that sexual exploitation was a growing threat to young people in Northern Ireland. That report also said that some abusers were thought to have links to paramilitary groups.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A child sexual exploitation report has found police made no sustained effort to find out who was responsible for abusing children in the care system.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: They are the stars of a new South Korean apocalyptic thriller terrorising audiences and breaking box office records at home and set to open in cinemas across Asia this week. Director Yeon Sang-ho's adrenaline-filled Train to Busan premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival. Blood, brains and mayhem all feature prominently as hordes of zombies devour unfortunate passengers trapped on board a bullet train from Seoul. Train to Busan is South Korea's first home-grown zombie offering and has already achieved local box office success, taking a record $5.76m (\u00c2\u00a34.33m) on its opening day in July. The movie starts off with an innocent enough train journey, until a viral outbreak outside starts to infect passengers on board, turning them into the undead. The Korean government eventually declares a state of emergency and martial law. At the heart of the chaos is actor Gong Yoo, a typically-workaholic South Korean businessman travelling with his estranged daughter, oblivious to the unfolding apocalypse. The monsters are fast, really fast, and their attacks lightning speed, putting their Hollywood counterparts from World War Z to shame. Equally terrifying is the infection and the rate at which it spreads rapidly between those unlucky enough to be trapped onboard as the high-speed train races to its final destination. To young Koreans like student Hahn Kwan-woo, 23, it is the film they have been waiting for. \"Western films featuring zombies have always been huge hits in our country and there was not a single Korean zombie movie until 'Train to Busan' came out,\" he said. \"Many of my favourite actors also star in the movie.\" It may have all the predictable elements of a zombie story, but aficionados have also praised the film's uniquely South Korean take on the genre. \"With a Mers epidemic [Middle East respiratory syndrome] sweeping South Korea in 2015 and soaring discontent with corruption and economic disparity, a zombie apocalypse serves as a potent allegory for the dog-eat-dog world,\" film critic Maggie Lee explained in one review. Stunning visual and special effects and \"lean, gritty\" screenplay also could not have hurt its chances of domestic success. Other critics praised the \"brilliant\" choice of setting on a Korean bullet train. \"I even have a friend who loved it because she takes the same train every time she goes home,\" said Mr Hahn. But timing was also key, due to the appetite for summertime horror movies, said Jean Lee, a journalist and Wilson Center Global Fellow who also teaches Korean culture and film courses. \"South Korean horror films really took off in the late 1990s and 'Train to Busan' is a new twist on the horror genre,\" she told BBC News from Seoul. \"Most horror movies here are released in the summer, when the heat and humidity send people into air-conditioned theatres for movies that quite literally send a chill up their spines.\" Of course the best part about zombie movies is getting to see the best and worst of humanity, as the world comes to an end. \"'Train to Busan': Best zombie scare ever. This is coming from someone who can't even watch 'The Walking Dead',\" wrote one fan on Twitter, referencing the popular US drama series. Some even proclaimed it the \"best zombie movie\" they have ever seen. Fans like 24-year-old Oh Won-heo hope the movie will propel home-grown horror films to an international audience. \"When people mention Asian horror, they think of Japan. But Korean horror tales are truly frightening and I hope 'Train to Busan' will make the world realise that our local movies are just as scary - or even better.\" However, he added: \"For my sake, I hope Hollywood will not ruin it with a remake.\" On that point he may be out of luck - European and US film studios are already reported to be vying to make their own version.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Snakes on planes are old hat - it's zombies on trains you need to worry about this year.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Speaking to the BBC at the Paris Airshow, Mr Bregier said the aircraft manufacturer was committed to its 16,000 employees based in the UK. He added Airbus had no plans to relocate its British factories. Airbus has said in the past that a \"Brexit\" might change its plans. Last month, Airbus UK's chief executive, Paul Kahn, said that if the UK voted to leave the EU in the planned in-out referendum, Airbus would reconsider future investment in the UK. On Tuesday, Mr Bregier admitted he would have to make a judgement about what the consequences would be for the competitiveness of his business following the referendum. His comments come as ministers tabled an amendment to the EU referendum bill on Monday evening, ruling out holding the plebiscite on 5 May 2016, the same day as Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish assembly elections and local elections. It means the referendum is unlikely to take place before the autumn of 2016, depending on the prime minister's ability to negotiate concessions from his European counterparts and despite calls for the UK to get the vote over with. Businesses have repeated raised concerns about the level of uncertainty caused by the timing of the referendum and the potential economic harm caused as investment decisions are delayed as a result. Last month, Mr Kahn said the UK must compete for international investment. \"The best way to guarantee this is by remaining part of the EU,\" he said. \"I believe that it is vital for a company such as Airbus to come out and make a stand in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union.\" Airbus, the world's second-largest aircraft manufacturer after Boeing, employs 6,000 people at its site at Broughton, north Wales, where it assembles the wings for all Airbus aircraft. Several thousand more people are employed at Filton, near Bristol, designing wings and testing landing gear. Mr Kahn stressed that if the UK were to leave the EU, the company would not suddenly close. But he added: \"If after an exit from the European Union, economic conditions in Britain were less favourable for business than in other parts of Europe, or beyond, would Airbus reconsider future investment in the United Kingdom? Yes, absolutely.\" Airbus is one of Europe's biggest industrial enterprises spanning civil aviation, defence and space, with operations in Germany, France and Spain. In the event of a British exit from the EU, Mr Kahn suggested the company could face more red tape in areas such as work visas and trade barriers. He said he was not \"blindly supporting Britain's membership of the EU\", adding: \"I welcome the UK government's intentions to deliver positive and hoped-for reforms - which would create a leaner and more efficient EU.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier has said he has \"no intention\" of pulling manufacturing out of the UK if the country votes to leave the European Union (EU).", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger. Mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet. Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life. Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home. It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth. Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\" The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth. Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own. Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's. The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet. The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars. Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star. This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met. Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet. Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date. \"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue. \"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\" While similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth. \"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission. \"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\" \"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\" Dr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet. \"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make. \"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\" Dr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii. \"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?\" He added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating. \"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\" The findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device The Premier League side led when Calum Chambers superbly curled in from 18 yards with the outside of his foot. Championship side Burnley hit back as Sam Vokes headed in Tendayi Darikwa's cross and an Alex Iwobi interception denied Andre Gray after the break. Sanchez - making his first start since November - finished coolly to win it. The Chile international - who has made just one substitute appearance since suffering a hamstring injury in November - was lively throughout and turned in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross after Darikwa was dispossessed in midfield. There can be no doubt the holders deserved a place in Sunday's draw as they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and chances, though Burnley created a nervy finish. The impressive Gray caught sight of goal late on but could not get meaningful power in his shot and as the visitors threw bodies forward, substitute Theo Walcott missed a glorious chance to add a third on the break as he failed to round Tom Heaton. Arsenal's match programme featured the FA Cup trophy on the front cover along with the words \"To have and to hold\". They move a step closer to emulating the Blackburn Rovers side of 1886 by winning a third FA Cup in a row, though this was far from vintage. They made nine changes to the side beaten by Chelsea last weekend but still fired 23 shots at the Burnley goal as Arsene Wenger maintained his record of only losing to lower-league opposition once in 41 FA Cup ties. Solid appearances from the likes of Chambers and Iwobi show he has a squad capable of maintaining a challenge in this competition but the anxious moments - particularly with the ball in the air in their box - will continue prompt some concern. Mohamed Elneny saw more of the ball than any other player - with 100 touches - on his first outing since joining for \u00a35m from Basel earlier this month. His completion of 96% of his passes was impressive but as a deep midfielder, he often found himself with plenty of time on the ball, meaning there will be tougher tests to come. \"I felt he started a bit cautious, played a bit secure,\" said Wenger of Elneny. \"He became more adventurous. It will take him some time to adjust to the power side of our game here, but the intelligence, the mobility and the technical level are good.\" While Elneny was steady between the penalty areas, Sanchez was pivotal inside the box. He did not break stride to slam home his goal, created the opener for Chambers and looked lively throughout. His return could be crucial ahead of a key February when Arsenal play the likes of leaders Leicester, Barcelona and Manchester United. Like Arsenal, Burnley sit third in their respective table and their offering at the Emirates shows they have the grit needed to win promotion back to the top tier at the first time of asking. Gray missed an early one-on-one chance and looked set to put his side 2-1 up after the re-start but for Iwobi's last-ditch intervention. His manager Sean Dyche was bold in making just two changes with a league fixture at Sheffield Wednesday to come on Tuesday. But the Clarets looked cohesive and more finishing of the quality Vokes displayed could have asked tough questions of the Premier League side. They undoubtedly look capable of staying the pace in the second tier. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"Burnley are a good side. For the first 20 minutes we looked quite in control but when they equalised suddenly you could see, energy, commitment, and we had to dig deep to win the game. Every free-kick you worry because Sam Vokes is very strong in the air and he scored their goal - they are strong on set pieces and we needed to be alert.\" Burnley manager Sean Dyche: \"It was a closer-run affair this year, and we had some good chances. I'm really pleased with the growth my players have shown in that year, but we didn't quite have enough and ultimately the disappointment is we haven't gone through.\" Arsenal host Southampton on Tuesday - where they could go top of the Premier League - and Burnley travel to Sheffield Wednesday on the same night as they bid to close a four-point gap to the automatic promotion places.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Nama sold its entire Northern Ireland portfolio to Cerberus, a US investment fund, in 2014. The Irish Times has reported that the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) will say that failings in the sales process could have resulted in \"hundred of millions of euro\" not being realised. Nama, an Irish state agency, was established in 2009 to take control of billions of euro of bad property loans which were damaging the Irish banks. Controversy around the sales process has centred on the role of the businessman and former Nama advisor Frank Cushnahan. While working as an advisor to Nama he began talking to a US investment fund, Pimco, which was interested in buying the portfolio. He then left his Nama role and went on to assist the fund with its bid. He was due to be paid \u00a35m if the bid succeeded - but it collapsed when Nama learned of Mr Cushnahan's role. Subsequently only two other firms made offers to buy the Northern Ireland portfolio. The highest bid of \u00a31.24bn - a fraction above the minimum reserve price - was made by Cerberus. The other offer from Fortress was for \u00a31.1bn, which was below the reserve. Earlier this year, the BBC Spotlight programme broadcast a covert recording in which Mr Cushnahan claimed he was also due to be paid a fee in relation to the Cerberus deal. The Irish Times reports that the C&AG will say that \"while it impossible to be definitive\", shortcomings in the sales process meant Nama did not receive hundreds of millions of euro that it might otherwise have. A Nama spokesman said: \"We're not making any comment and will respond when the report is published.\" In a statement, the Department of Finance in Dublin, said: \"'The minister will brief his cabinet colleagues at an upcoming government meeting. \"The report will be published thereafter. No further comment will be made until after publication.\" Mr Cushnahan has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to his Nama role. Cerberus has said that the sales process for the loan portfolio was \"conducted with full integrity\" on its part. Earlier this week, BBC NI's Spotlight programme reported that Mr Cushnahan was recorded accepting a \u00a340,000 cash payment from a Nama borrower. Mr Cushnahan, who was advising Nama at the time, has denied any wrongdoing. Following the broadcast, First Minister Arlene Foster rejected a call by Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness for a cross-border Nama inquiry saying it was \"not appropriate\".

Amara arrived in Norwich from West Africa a fortnight ago and was turned down by two landlords - one by letter. Both were happy for him to stay until he handed over his passport and they realised he was from a country at the centre of the current epidemic. He told Newsbeat that he was \"devastated to be turned down\". The letter said: \"Under normal circumstance. Your profile would be a great profile to be one of our lodgers. \"However, given that the world is about to probably experience an Ebola epidemic, we have decided not to accept anyone that has been anywhere near the ebola outbreak within the last two months, or is likely to visit those areas in the near future.\" Amara, 35, told Newsbeat that it is wrong to assume all people from Sierra Leone carry the disease. He says: \"It's very unreasonable. And if you think everybody coming from Sierra Leone is affected, then that's just completely unfair.\" The good news for Amara is that after a few weeks of looking, he's found somewhere to stay so he can continue his studies. More than 4,400 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, mainly in West Africa. Britain has now begun screening passengers at Heathrow airport. People arriving from the worst-affected countries will be questioned and may have their temperatures taken. Professor Tom Solomon is an expert on diseases like Ebola and how they spread. How worried should we be here in the UK? I think we should be worried about Ebola in West Africa because sadly the cases have gone up and up but the situation in the UK is very different from the situation in West Africa. Was the landlord right to be so cautious? I understand why people are concerned about Ebola but what people need to do is look at the facts and then make sensible decisions. You're not going to get Ebola from renting your flat to someone from Sierra Leone. How do people get Ebola? Ebola is passed on if someone is in contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is actually sick with the disease. So clearly letting out your property wont put people at risk. Is the virus going to become airborne? There is no evidence that the virus is airborne and we have never seen the virus change and become airborne - so there is no evidence to say that this will happen here.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Exeter Chiefs boss Rob Baxter also says a \"sacking culture\" comparable to football is creeping into rugby union. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill became the third boss sacked in eight months on Monday, while five left in five years before 2016. \"It appears that coaches are a lot more vulnerable than they had been,\" said RCA founder and director Richard Moon. Moon, a former Harlequins scrum-half and Rugby Football Union committee member who established the forerunner to the Rugby Players' Association, said one of the main reasons for setting up the RCA in 2012 was to prevent a \"football-like\" situation from developing. But, when asked whether rugby union was heading towards a hire-and-fire approach, Baxter told BBC Spotlight: \"The facts state that it is.\" The 45-year-old, who has been in charge of the club since 2009 when they were in the second tier, said job security for directors of rugby and coaches will \"unfortunately be driven by the professional game, the need to stay in the Premiership or be successful in the Premiership\". Cockerill was the second director of rugby sacked this season after Andy Robinson at Bristol, with Mike Ford leaving Bath as head coach last term - just 12 months after being named Premiership coach of the year and having only recently been linked with the England job. Moon said the timing of recent departures was more damning than the increase in sackings themselves. \"There have been more - but ever more interestingly it's when they are happening,\" said Moon. \"They are tending, more recently, to happen during a season rather than at the end of a season. \"As an association we are keeping an eye on these developments. More and more, if coaches are not given a reasonable and realistic chance to get to where they want to be in a season, short-termism is of real concern.\" Cockerill was sacked 12 games into the campaign with Leicester fifth in the table, just five points adrift of Bath in fourth spot, and having led Tigers to semi-finals in both the Premiership and European Champions Cup only last season. In his eight years in charge, Leicester never failed to reach the Premiership play-offs - winning three titles and finishing runners-up twice. Robinson, the former England and Scotland head coach, was sacked by Bristol 10 games into the Premiership season, after guiding them back to the top flight following a seven-year absence last May. \"There is more short-termism because rugby is big business now,\" added Moon. \"There is more expectation on rugby coaches, certainly in the Premiership, to deliver - and if they are not delivering in a short time frame it would seem that owners are being more proactive than they have been in the past. \"Coaches seem to be judged on short-term goals and results. Are they judged a bit like football managers in their first two or three games? Or do you get to Christmas, Easter or the Premiership play-offs? That time period is getting smaller and smaller.\" Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond admits his job is under scrutiny at the AJ Bell Stadium - with Sharks on an eight-match losing run - but he denies the turnover of coaches can be compared to football. \"Are we under pressure? Definitely, we need to get some results,\" Diamond told BBC Radio Manchester. \"But we know what we are doing and there is no-one better to get us out of the hole we are in than me.\" When asked if he thought recent sackings were reactionary, Diamond said: \"No, not really. Each club is run differently and every club has different pressures.\" Tigers, English rugby's most successful club with 10 domestic titles, last won silverware in 2013, beating Northampton Saints in the last of nine straight Premiership final appearances. Leicester lock Ed Slater said the recent spate of sackings were \"what you guys want to write about\" when questioned by BBC Radio Leicester on the subject. \"Cockers had been here for a long time,\" he said. \"We haven't been to a Premiership final for three years now and at a club like Leicester we are aware of expectations and he ultimately paid the price - we know we want to win silverware and are expected to win silverware. \"Four years without something is a long spell.\" Exeter boss Baxter said the growing popularity of Premiership rugby and increased riches in the game is where the pressure comes from. \"The demands of crowds and rugby clubs and the money that is starting to come into the game through TV, a lot of these things are very positive - we work very hard to build our supporter base and a product that people want to buy. \"Unfortunately, one of the repercussions of that is that people become more demanding. Sometimes, rightly or wrongly, in pursuit of success - or what is deemed to be success - someone pays the price. \"The fact the Premiership is so competitive is something people should cherish and not be too afraid of. That is the balance you would like to think most clubs would come to. \"You understand that a season will tilt with one or two injuries or one or two results. Having the strength to see that through is hopefully what we will get back to in rugby and we won't see a cascade of sackings. \"Some sackings and some changes of management happen for reasons outside of rugby results and those always happen - but when purely based on results people need a little more understanding.\" Moon says he spoke to Richard Bevan, chief executive of football's League Managers' Association (LMA), when forming the RCA and believes rugby coaches face some harsher realities than their football counterparts. \"Unlike football, there is not enough professional or semi-professional clubs out there to realistically believe that if you lose your job you will walk into another one at the same level immediately. It is very rare,\" said Moon. \"It is important that coaches get the right level of support and backing that their day job deserves. \"Richard was incredibly helpful when we identified this idea. They are a juggernaut of an organisation that have been going for a long time and they do invaluable work. \"We are some way behind that in the rugby world.\" Chris Jones, BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter \"It is not necessarily a case that suddenly rugby union has adopted a different culture compared to before, but perhaps there are changes as a result of the competitiveness of the Premiership - influenced by the greater central revenues from Rugby Football Union and TV money - coupled with the new private investment at some clubs. \"There are probably seven or eight clubs who truly feel they should occupy the top four - or be even better off - in the Premiership. \"These clubs include Saracens, Wasps, Exeter, Bath, Leicester, Northampton, Harlequins, Gloucester, while Sale are a club that firmly considers themselves to be a top-six side. In saying that, Bristol, Worcester and Newcastle are all highly ambitious as well. \"Wasps and Sale have been boosted by fairly recent private investment, while Gloucester are on the verge of a takeover. Bristol have a billionaire owner too. These are people who all want success, while the traditional powerhouses such as Leicester, Northampton and Harlequins also demand results. \"No club is content with its status quo - maybe apart from European and Premiership champions Saracens - and with high expectations from fans and in the boardrooms, comes pressure on coaches - and sackings.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The recent spike in Premiership sackings shows a \"worrying trend\", says the Rugby Coaches Association (RCA).", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Why change? Let him carry on.\" Speaking after his side moved five points clear of the relegation zone, Shakespeare said: \"My remit was to win these two games and that's what we've done,\" he said. \"The owners will make a decision for the good of the club and until I talk to them I don't know what that will be.

Shakespeare has never managed a club before but has a long association with the Foxes. The Englishman was assistant manager to Nigel Pearson for two years from 2008, following Pearson to Hull in 2010 before they both returned to Leicester a year later. Following Pearson's sacking in 2015, Shakespeare remained at the club as Ranieri's assistant.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The firm will resume in-house domestic vinyl production at a Japanese factory south-west of Tokyo by March 2018. The move comes amid renewed demand for old-fashioned black plastic records, which now occupy a key market niche. At one time, the format had been expected to disappear after the rise of CDs, digital downloads and streaming. During vinyl's long decline from the late 1980s onwards, many vinyl record factories closed down, with production confined to a few specialist independent firms. But this year, global vinyl revenue is expected to hit $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3770m), with many consumers swearing by its supposedly superior sound quality. Analysis: Jonty Bloom, business correspondent They said the CD had killed it and that digital downloads had left it dead and buried: but vinyl is back. Sony, which played a major part in killing off vinyl by developing CDs, has seen them replaced in turn by other music technology such as downloads and streaming, but vinyl is increasingly popular once again. The format has been saved by a resurgence in demand, as it attracts not only nostalgic older consumers, but also younger generations who have rediscovered records, especially in clubs and at music festivals. Sony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records. Part of the reason for the popularity of vinyl records may be that you can actually sell them in shops. In the UK, record sales brought in more money last year than streaming platforms - although the unit costs of vinyl is many times that of streaming. Vinyl records have been growing in popularity again in recent years, boosted by events such as Record Store Day in April every year, for which record companies produce special limited-edition singles and albums. Sony's move comes a few months after it equipped its Tokyo studio with a cutting lathe, used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records. It has not yet said which titles it will be pressing in vinyl, but big sellers in the format these days are a mixture of classic back-catalogue items and modern releases by new bands.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Sony Music, one of the big three global record companies, says it will start pressing its own vinyl releases again for the first time since 1989.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Seven organisations have issued joint advice on vitamin D, which the body gets from natural sunlight. The nutrient keeps bones strong, and protects against conditions like osteoporosis. The guidance was drawn up because it is thought fears about skin cancer have made people too cautious about being in the sun. Cancer Research UK and the National Osteoporosis Society are among the bodies which agree that \"little and frequent\" spells in summer sunshine several times a week can benefit your health. The experts now say it is fine to go outside in strong sun in the middle of the day, as long as you cover up or apply sunscreen before your skin goes red. Professor Rona Mackie, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said: \"Total sun protection with high factor suncream on all the time is not ideal, in terms of vitamin D levels. \"Even Australia has changed its policy on this. They're now producing charts showing parts of Australia where sun protection may not be required during some parts of the year. \"Some of the messages about sun exposure have been too negative. UK summer sunshine isn't desperately strong. We don't have many days in the year when it is very intense. \"What's changed is that we're now saying that exposure of 10 to 15 minutes to the UK summer sun, without suncream, several times a week is probably a safe balance between adequate vitamin D levels and any risk of skin cancer.\" Official government advice already recommends vitamin D supplements for pregnant women and children aged under five. But the experts who wrote the joint statement say mothers often are not made aware of this recommendation. They suggest women consult their GP. Winter levels of vitamin D can be helped by a break in the tropical sun - or by eating oily fish, liver and fortified margarine. Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, Professor Peter Johnson, said: \"A good diet and sensible sun exposure will be adequate for the great majority of the UK population to minimise their cancer risk. \"The area of vitamin D and cancer is complex. \"There's some evidence, which is strongest in bowel cancer, that low levels of vitamin D in the blood correlate with the risk of developing cancer. \"But that doesn't mean those low levels cause bowel cancer. \"We think overall that low levels of vitamin D are unlikely to be major contributors to the chances of developing cancer in the UK population.\" The joint statement also highlighted questions about vitamin D that warrant further research. These include finding out the optimal levels of vitamin D, and more detail about the role of dietary sources and supplements.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "New health advice recommends short spells in the sun - without suncream and in the middle of the day.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Radical preachers will be banned from posting material online and anyone with convictions for extremist activity will be barred from working with children. Deradicalisation classes will be made mandatory for others deemed a threat. But Muslim leaders warned the strategy \"continues down a flawed path\" and risks \"alienating\" Muslims in the UK. Also among the measures within the counter-extremism strategy are: Prime Minister David Cameron said the plan would work because it was \"comprehensive\" . \"It's no good leaving this simply to the police or the intelligence services. It's no good simply talking about violent extremism. We need to confront all extremism,\" he said. He said its effectiveness would be measured by whether people were being turned away from extremism, stopped from travelling to fight for IS, and by having \"more cohesive and integrated communities\". Home Secretary Theresa May said non-violent extremism could not go \"uncontested\" as it led to the erosion of women's rights, the spread of intolerance and bigotry and the separation of some communities \"from the mainstream\". She said that applied to neo-Nazi extremism just as much as Islamist doctrine. The Muslim Council of Britain has released a highly-critical statement in response to the plans. Secretary general Dr Shuja Shafi said the strategy would \"reinforce perceptions that all aspects of Muslim life must undergo a 'compliance' test to prove our loyalty to this country\". \"These measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself,\" he said. Dr Shafi also said he detected \"McCarthyist undertones\" in the plans to create blacklists and exclude and ban people those deemed to be extremists. Mr Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said the announcement was a \"missed opportunity to really engage the Muslim community\". But Fiyaz Mughal, director of the interfaith Faith Matters organisation, said there was much in the plans that could \"help in the battle against those who promote extremism\". Robin Brant, BBC political correspondent At the heart of this considerable strategy on counter extremism are two significant challenges for the prime minister: the internet and the law. Getting inciteful content off the web and getting \"counter narrative\" content up there is key to harnessing the full potential of a medium that IS has already mastered. There has been much focus on the mosques but bedroom radicalisation is something the prime minister and MI5 worry intensely about. The process of trying to persuade Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants to help is ongoing. On the second point, the plans to introduce new powers to restrict what extremists can do and where they can go are still in their legal infancy. The government concedes they will need to be properly targeted. It is still consulting with lawyers and community groups to try to get the balance right. Police estimate at least 700 people from the UK have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq, such as the so-called Islamic State, and the government believes tackling non-violent extremism is key to stemming the flow of people. Parents of children aged under 16 have had the power to request the cancellation of passports - even where a child has taken or hidden the actual document - since July. That power is being extended to parents of 16 and 17-year-olds, allowing families to contact a passport office where officials will investigate their concerns before a final decision is taken by the home secretary. Mrs May said the measure had only been used by \"a small number\" of parents since July, but it was part of a package of new powers that would help tackle extremism. Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said it was \"crucial we get the balance right\" and that Mr Cameron must \"be very careful not to use the language he used earlier in the summer that somehow the Muslim community is not standing up to terrorism\". Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the announcements amounted to \"rhetoric that may well divide communities and make our job of working with those communities to find and isolate terrorists and potential terrorists that much harder\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The home secretary has vowed to \"systematically confront and challenge extremist ideology\" as she detailed new curbs on those who \"spread hate\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Charity Action Duchenne said a new facility could improve the quality of life and lifespan of sufferers. The Welsh government has said it is working to improve services and support for those with muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most severe of the muscular dystrophies, according to the Action Duchenne charity. The charity said the disease, which affects mainly boys, was 100% fatal. Sufferers are diagnosed usually by the age of five and without good medical intervention they rarely live beyond their late teens and twenties, it said. Wales was the only country in the UK to screen newborn children for the condition, but screening was withdrawn at the end of November. The Welsh government said the test was no longer reliable. Around 100 parents and campaigners gathering at the Welsh assembly on Tuesday are also seeking matched funding to support new research that could deliver a cure for the disease in the next few years. Nick Catlin, of Action Duchenne, said advances in medicine made a longer lifespan and improved quality of life for all young men living with Duchenne \"a real possibility\". \"It is a critical time to invest in research for treatments that will see the condition stabilised to enable our young people to live longer,\" said Mr Catlin. He added: \"Without further funding and government support we cannot achieve our goal of providing personalised care and support into adulthood to improve the quality of life for those living with Duchenne.\" John Burke, who lives in Cardiff and whose three-year-old son, Seth, has the disease, is among those taking part in a lobby at the Welsh assembly. He told BBC Radio Wales that from the outside Seth looked just like a normal, happy, healthy little boy. But he added: \"Unfortunately for me and his mum it's just a waiting and watching game. \"It's a progressive illness. We know that things will get worse in time. Boys start to lose their mobility, they start to fall over. Quite early on boys are in wheelchairs before they reach their teenage years. \"It then starts to affect the rest of their muscles and that particularly includes their respiratory muscles, their heart, the major muscles of the body and that all needs lots of attention, lots of specialist care to look at.\" Mr Burke said a specialist centre in Wales would give Seth access to all the help he needed, all under one roof. \"You get to see respiratory physicians, cardiac physicians,\" he said. \"You get to see experts in neuro-muscular conditions.\" Mr Burke said Wales should follow the Danish model of treatement, where men were living into their 30s and 40s as opposed to the average life expectancy of 19 to 21 in the UK. In May, Welsh health minister Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh government was working to improve services and support for individuals and their families who are living with muscular dystrophy. Ms Griffiths said she was committed to ensuring that all patients with conditions such as muscular dystrophy had personal care plans. She added that clinical staff had said further investment should be used for specialist occupational therapists and psychology staff.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Parents of children with a muscle wasting disease have called on ministers to create a specialist centre to help sufferers in Wales.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The three judges scored the 12-round bout 115-112 to Burns, 115-113 to Beltran and 114-114, which did not seem to reflect Beltran flooring Burns or his dislocating the champion's jaw. Brave Burns was constantly pushed back and landed heavily on occasion. And his courage was rewarded, controversially, when he retained his belt. Burns's preparations were unlike any of his 38 previous fights. His wife had given birth to their first child, his son Leon's safe arrival coming only nine days ago after a four-day labour. The question troubling his fans was what state of mind would he be in to face a challenger known for being a regular sparring partner of the legendary Manny Pacquiao? The opening blows were fairly evenly shared, both fighters lively and aggressive, while in the second round Beltran had the champion pinned on the ropes for a spell, though Burns managed to take most of the Mexican's artillery on his arms. Burns promised he had learned from , principally in the way he had over-stretched to land blows on his reclining opponent, only to be caught on the counter. His exertions in the third round, though, suggested he was still trying to blow the challenger away and he was caught several times with Beltran's left hook before using his jab to good effect. Beltran stepped up the pace in the fourth and had Burns reeling from two crunching lefts, the second wobbling the 30-year-old from Coatbridge. The challenger, two years Burns's senior, was controlling the ring and he had the best of the exchanges in round five, though Burns, often on the back foot, had cleared his head and was occasionally getting through the Arizona-based fighter's guard. Burns continued to use the counter-attack, more out of necessity than choice, to inflict pain on Beltran. His reward was to land two excellent shots to Beltran's head in the closing stages of the sixth. The home fighter's recovery continued into the seventh as he made good use of a quick left jab, right-cross combination. But in the eighth round the champion was floored for the first time in three years with a sickening left hook to the head. Burns took the count of eight to gather his senses and to his credit had the guts to hang in there and land a peach of a left hook on Beltran's chin. Worryingly for Burns's camp, the challenger did not flinch. The Scot's refusal to panic paid dividends in his bout against Gonzalez, when his opponent retired injured after nine rounds. Similarly, he kept calm in this bout despite that knockdown and the pain in his jaw and gave his all in rounds nine and 10, without truly disrupting the forward momentum of Beltran. The crowd feared that Burns might need a knockout in the final two rounds to retain his belt but the technical and tactical nous of Beltran made this seem a forlorn wish. Again and again, the fans witnessed the wonderfully composed Mexican break Burns's increasingly erratic defences without risking a knockout blow himself. The final round signalled more of the same, sporadic bursts by Burns merely interrupting the hail of leather-clad fists. But when the MC announced a draw, Beltran sharply exited the ring while the home fans, though proud of their brave champion, squirmed at the result. On the undercard, Edinburgh's Stephen Simmons lifted the WBC international cruiserweight silver championship title with a deserved unanimous points win over Germany's David Graf, though the Scot suffered a nasty cut under his left eye in the fifth round. Scott Cardle, from Lytham St Annes, with plenty of home support from the Glaswegian side of his family, beat Fishburn's Gary Fox, taking a 79-73 points decision in their lightweight contest. Liverpool's 2010 Commonwealth Games silver medal winner Callum Smith dispatched Lithuanian super-middleweight Kirill Psonko in the first round. Glasgow's Jonathan Slowey, 22, made it 15 straight wins by outpointing his rangy Spanish opponent Angel Lorente. The unanimous decision of the three judges landed him the WBC international featherweight silver championship. Garnant's 25-year-old Prizefighter winner Chris Jenkins beat the French light-welterweight Laurent Ferra on points. It was also at that weight that Lochend Boxing Club's Paul Appleby made a winning return to the ring 15 months after his defeat by John Simpson.

The inquiry will focus on the existing rules, as set out in the 2000 Political Parties and Referendum Act, the government's case for amending them, how ministers plan to go about it and the impact it will have on the impartiality of the civil service. In a vote on the issue last month, 27 Conservative MPs rebelled against their party, urging ministers to reinstate the full purdah period although the government won the vote after Labour abstained. The government has said the existing rules would potentially prevent ministers from attending EU meetings and making decisions with a European dimension. They have insisted they will address MPs' concerns about this and other matters - such as the funding available to different sides and the length of the campaign itself - as the bill makes its way through the Commons. The committee will publish its report on 22 July.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Plans to relax so-called \"purdah rules\" on government announcements in the run-up to the EU referendum are to be the subject of a quickfire inquiry by MPs.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Michael Gunn, a retired chartered accountant, wants to spend some of it on a new roof for the church hall. But in defiance of experts, he also wants to use the money for a transatlantic cruise. The changes take effect on Bank Holiday Monday, so Mr Gunn will receive the payment on Tuesday morning. \"I had no idea they'd whisk me into the limelight, and say I am the first,\" he told the BBC. \"But I don't mind that.\" Initially he wants to donate cash to the fund for the church hall roof - in the village of Newton Poppleford - after it burnt down in a fire. But later in the year he is planning to take his wife across the Atlantic on board the Queen Mary Two. Mr Gunn was not prepared to say how much he would be taking out of his pension pot, but he has taken care to heed warnings about tax bills. \"What I like about this is that you are totally in charge of how much tax you are exposed to - to stay within a lower tax band,\" he said. Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said thousands of people withdrawing money might find themselves paying much more tax than they needed to. Other experts have pointed out that, in any case, people taking out cash will have to pay what is called \"emergency tax\". Unless individuals can show a P45 tax form, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will treat any payments as if they are a new monthly salary. In other words, they will charge tax on the basis that the new income is repeated every month for a year. So anyone cashing in a pension of \u00c2\u00a318,000 - assuming nothing is taken tax-free- would be charged an immediate tax bill of \u00c2\u00a36,592. Those in that position will have to reclaim the tax using forms P50 or P53. However HMRC has promised they will get the money back within a month. Meanwhile, hundreds of staff from Citizens Advice - and Citizens Advice Scotland - are preparing to offer free face-to-face interviews with anyone who needs help, from Tuesday. Those aged 55 or over can go to one of 500 offices in England and Wales, or 90 in Scotland. Those living in very remote areas of Scotland can arrange home visits. But customers will only receive \"guidance\", not advice. \"What we don't do is provide any details of which companies people can go to for pensions - or which particular products,\" said Richard Chilton, one of those who will be conducting the interviews. \"But we provide guidance on what the options are,\" he said. Anyone wanting to book an interview, or receive telephone guidance, should call the Pension Wise service, on 030 0330 1001. Are you planning to cash in your pension?

Researchers included bonuses, pension contributions and redundancy payments, as well as salaries, in the sums. The Taxpayers' Alliance said some of the figures were concerning. In particular, the lobby group highlighted the sums being paid to senior managers. The overwhelming majority of staff on six-figure salaries were clinical, including GPs, hospital consultants and dentists. But nearly 2,400 of the staff were employed by NHS bodies in the UK in non-clinical roles - of these 472 earned more than \u00a3150,000. The Daily Mail said its analysis of annual accounts of NHS bodies showed that the pay bill for NHS directors had risen by 22% in two years. Another 534 employees of quangos were also on six-figure salaries. Taxpayers' Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: \"No-one begrudges paying doctors and nurses well for the tough jobs they do, but it's galling to see bosses at failing hospitals continuing to rake in the cash. \"It's an insult to taxpayers, but it's even worse for patients who have suffered because of mismanagement and worse. \"The rewards-for-failure culture is rife in the NHS and it must be stamped out as a matter of urgency.\" However, separate figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre have shown that overall the number of managers in the health service in England, including senior and lower level ones, has been falling. There are now just over 37,600 employed - down by nearly a fifth in five years. Ministers in England also pointed out that they had written to NHS bodies to discourage \"retire and rehire\" practices where staff get lucrative pay-offs and then start working again in closely linked jobs, while any salaries above the level of the prime minister's now needed to be scrutinised by the Department of Health. Health Minister David Prior said: \"We are absolutely clear that value for money for the taxpayer is vital, every pound that is wasted or spent unnecessarily is a pound that cannot be spent on looking after patients.\" Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, defended the pay levels, saying being a chief executive in the NHS \"was one of the toughest jobs in the country\".

{"article": "###\nArticle: Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK imposed no migration controls on eight central European and Baltic nations joining the EU in 2004 and the new proposals would \"address the consequences\" of that. But he said the emergency brake would only apply in \"exceptional cases\". Eurosceptics say it is ineffectual and could make the situation worse. Speaking in the European Parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was a \"handbrake turn\" by David Cameron. The prime minister has hailed a plan to allow the UK to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years as one of the key elements of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU - the details of which he will set out to the UK Parliament later. He has said the emergency brake, which would take effect if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system, could be triggered almost immediately. But many Tory MPs have criticised the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive \"graduated\" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that. They are also unhappy that the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally. Defending the proposals and the rest of the draft deal in the European Parliament, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the entire package - which must be approved by the EU as a whole, was \"fair to the UK and fair to the other 27 EU states\". On welfare, he said: \"We propose to create a safeguard mechanism tailor-made to the concerns of the UK, that would allow it to restrict the excess of EU workers newly entering its Labour market to in-work benefits in a graduated manner for a period of up to four years. \"The duration of the mechanism will be limited in time - that is a crucial characteristic of a safeguard mechanism, necessary to make it compatible with the (EU) treaties. It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should.\" Mr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so. One of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK. Mr Juncker said \"as a result\" of that decision \"over the past decade, the UK attracted a record number of mobile EU citizens\". He added. \"In effect, we will enable the UK to use the safeguards mechanism to address the consequences of that decision.\" But UKIP leader Nigel Farage, also speaking in the European Parliament, said the safeguards were totally insubstantial and would not allow the UK to reduce levels of annual net migration, which rose to 336,000 in the year to June 2015. \"We have an emergency brake on migrants benefits. Wow. It was supposed to be a total ban on migrants benefits for four years. So it is hardly an emergency brake, it is more of a handbrake turn.\" Mr Farage said Mr Cameron would not be able to get any further concessions out of the EU and the forthcoming referendum on the UK's future in the EU would be a battle between \"vested self-interests and people power\". Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, who is now a leading MEP, suggested that if the UK voted to leave the EU, it would be a boost for Russia and China. \"I think Britain without Europe - ok it's a dwarf, let's be honest,\" he claimed. \"We Belgians, we know that we are dwarfs but maybe they're going to know it also. And at the other hand Europe without Great Britain, yes, doesn't count, is not a counterweight against China, against Russia, against the United States. \"It is Vladimir Putin, in fact, who wins in this game in the end because Putin likes a divided Europe.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Limiting in-work benefits to new EU arrivals will help tackle the effects of record migration to the UK since 2004, the EC's president has said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Ohio Governor John Kasich condemned their \"fantasy tax plans\" and added: \"We can't elect someone who doesn't know how to do the job.\" Mr Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who has edged past Mr Trump in national polls, had a quiet night in Boulder. His tax proposal, which is based on biblical tithes, was decried by Mr Kasich, who also dismissed Mr Trump's plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants and build a wall on the Mexico border. The five key confrontations Political friendships were strained by some of the testy exchanges, notably one between former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Mr Bush urged Mr Rubio, once his protege, to resign from the Senate because of his poor voting record. The media were also in the firing line - Texas Senator Ted Cruz got the night's biggest applause when he attacked the hosts, CNBC for stirring confrontation. \"The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media. This is not a cage match.\" The hostility against CNBC continued after the debate when Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus complained about the \"gotcha questions\". Twin contests played out on the stage in Colorado - a fight to become the candidate of the Republican establishment and a battle to become the standard bearer of the radical right. In the first contest, Jeb Bush delivered another listless performance that will deeply worry his donors, and a premeditated decision to attack his friend and rival Marco Rubio for absenteeism from his day job as the Florida senator backfired badly. It seemed so contrived, as Rubio, a big winner tonight, deftly pointed out. In the establishment contest, it was the defining exchange of the night, and will enhance Rubio's growing stature and further diminish Bush. The New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also outstripped Bush. As for a rumble in the Rockies between Donald Trump and the candidate who dislodged him in the polls, Ben Carson, it never unfolded. Trump was low-key - it seemed almost that he is tiring of the process. Carson disappeared for much of the debate. Perhaps sensing a chance to impose himself, the Texas Senator Ted Cruz delivered an impassioned attack on the moderators of the debate and the media more broadly for its liberal bias. Speaking of his born-again father will have impressed evangelicals. This was the best two hours of the Cruz campaign so far. But the main headline of the evening comes from Jeb Bush. He needed to energise his troubled campaign tonight, and he failed abysmally. Other highlights included: The four lowest-polling Republican candidates squared off in an early debate. Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina, got the most laughs, especially when he said Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders \"went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I don't think he ever came back\".

{"article": "###\nArticle: Petro Poroshenko said 80% of Ukraine's troops left on Wednesday morning after several days of fierce fighting. Russia said Ukrainian forces had tried to fight their way out of the town after being encircled but Mr Poroshenko insisted they were never surrounded. The rebel advance on Debaltseve, which came in spite of the recent ceasefire agreement, has been widely condemned. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the rebels' offensive had put the wider peace agreement at risk and urged Russia to \"use all its influence on the separatists to make them respect the ceasefire\". He also called on Moscow to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, saying Russian troops, artillery and air defence units were still active in the country. Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted the rebels' actions in Debaltseve had not violated the ceasefire because it was a rebel-held city when the peace agreement was signed last week. He urged rebels to provide troops who surrendered with food and clothes and said he hoped the situation in the city would \"not be used to find a pretext to actually undermine [the agreement]\". Eyewitnesses saw dozens of tanks and columns of weary Ukrainian troops retreating from Debaltseve on Wednesday. Russia's state-controlled Channel One TV showed footage of what it said were rebels raising their flag on top of a high-rise building in the town. Later rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin was quoted in Russian media as saying Debaltseve was fully under the control of separatists, although there were still \"disparate groups of the enemy\" in the southern part of town. One rebel commander in the city told the BBC that conditions were dire, with no electricity and a shortage of food and water. He said rebels were sharing their rations with the remaining civilians. President Poroshenko said in a statement: \"Debaltseve was under our control, there was no encirclement, and our troops left the area in a planned and organised manner.\" He called for \"a firm reaction from the world to Russia's brutal violation of the Minsk agreements, the ceasefire regime and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry\". Mr Poroshenko visited the soldiers who had left Debaltseve in the town of Artemivsk on Wednesday. Earlier, he said it would be an honour to shake hands with \"Ukrainian heroes\". A senior Ukrainian military official said 22 Ukrainian soldiers had died in Debaltseve over the past three days. Earlier, an official at a morgue in Artemivsk said the bodies of 25 Ukrainian soldiers had been brought to the facility from Debaltseve but this has not been confirmed. Rebels have claimed that hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed in clashes around the city, but Mr Poroshenko denied this. The government in Kiev admitted that that some soldiers were taken prisoner in Debaltseve, but gave no details on how many were seized. All Wednesday, the road out of Debaltseve into government-held territory thundered to the sound of retreating armour - tanks and troop carriers full of exhausted, sometimes defiant soldiers. In a bus by the side of the road, I found one Yuri slumped on his seat, across the aisle from a sleeping colleague. He said the situation had become increasingly dire and individual units had taken their own decisions to leave. They were running out of ammunition and in danger of being surrounded, he told me. He blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for deceiving everyone about the ceasefire. We know him well by now, he said. When he says something is guaranteed, that means there's some kind of trap coming up. In nearby fields, mortars and multiple rocket launchers fired back at the rebels - providing cover for those still trying to leave Debaltseve. President Poroshenko says the withdrawal was planned and organised, but on the ground it looked like a hasty retreat in the face of overwhelming odds. The withdrawal came after Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Ukraine's troops in Debaltseve to surrender. Mr Putin is due to speak by telephone later on Wednesday to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Mr Poroshenko, according to the French government. Spokesman Stephane Le Foll insisted the agreement announced last week by the four leaders to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine was not dead, and that progress had been made. International observers monitoring the truce have been unable to enter Debaltseve. The city has become a key prize for rebels and government forces, as it sits on a strategic railway line linking the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Most of its 25,000 population has been evacuated but about 7,000 civilians are still believed trapped by the fighting. The ceasefire, which came into effect on Sunday, has been broadly observed elsewhere and some rebel heavy weaponry was said to have been withdrawn. The UN says more than 5,600 people have been killed in the conflict, but there are fears the actual death toll could be much higher. Fighting began in eastern Ukraine in April, a month after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula. Ukraine's pro-Western government says Russia is supporting the separatists with troops and weapons, but the Kremlin has consistently denied this.

The album's first single, Bang Bang, addresses the culture of mass shootings, telling the story of one such incident through the eyes of a perpetrator.

On Saturday Mr Erdogan announced steps to put all armed forces under direct government control, amid a crackdown. He accuses US-based cleric Fetullah Gulen of being behind the coup attempt. At least 246 people died as rebel soldiers tried to seize power on 15 July. Mr Gulen denies any involvement. The latest soldiers to be dismissed include Mr Erdogan's chief military adviser, a top aide to the chief of the general staff and the defence minister's chief secretary. On Saturday the government announced plans to close all military academies and bring land, naval and air forces under the control of the defence ministry.

{"article": "###\nArticle: SuperTed was born in south Wales as a book, before becoming a much-loved TV series on both sides of the Atlantic. It was shown as one of Welsh language broadcaster S4C's first programmes in November 1982, before being translated into English and shown on BBC One the following year. Barry-born Young, now 70, has spent most of his working life in animation in California, working as an independent in Hollywood dominated by the big studios. The former advertising copywriter has now produced a feature-length animation, Norm Of The North, and his next film project is close to his heart - about a former legend with his beloved Cardiff City football club. A BEAR BEGINNING In 1978, Young created SuperTed as a story to read to his young stepson Richard, who was afraid of the dark, at bedtime. But the tales of the crime-solving superhero with special powers - and rivals like Texas Pete - soon got a wider audience. \"I went to the village hall one day to pick Richard up from play school and they said 'we love the SuperTed stories' and I said 'how do you know about those?' \"They said that 'he always tells us the story you told him last night'. \"We then got the books published, a couple of hundred were written, and then S4C came along and they wanted at least one thing which would travel all over the world - and it was successful. \"We became the first company to sell to Disney and we never looked back.\" Three TV series were made in the mid 1980s, with Derek Griffiths and Jon Pertwee providing the voices. Young also launched Welsh-language cartoon Wil Cwac Cwac and helped develop Fireman Sam. Now a new series of SuperTed is being planned, which Young again wants to make in Wales with some of the original team. HOLLYWOOD BECKONS Young and his wife Liz created Mike Young Productions - which later become Splash Entertainment - and moved to Los Angeles in 1989. With much bigger rivals in Hollywood, he called it \"one of the most stupid, crazy decisions you could make\". But the company flourished. As well as collaborations, its animations have included Chloe's Closet, Dive Olly Dive!, Hero:108, Growing Up Creepie, Pet Alien and ToddWorld. NORM OF THE NORTH Young's latest production is an animated feature film Norm Of the North about a polar bear. Norm, who can talk but cannot hunt, goes to New York with a gang of lemmings for adventure and to fight a tourism development in the Arctic. Although it does not have a big budget, the film uses the latest computer generated imagery (CGI) technology. \"We wanted to make something economic because I want the independents to have a chance and really get back into this business,\" said Young. \"It's all well and good having Disney, Pixar, Universal and DreamWorks but fundamentally they go a certain route but we can take more risks with what we do.\" The film, which includes voices from actors Rob Schneider and Bill Nighy, got its Welsh premiere at the Market Hall cinema in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, earlier this week. CARDIFF CITY FAN IS THE RIGHT MATCH He may live in California, but Cardiff City fan Young is now on the team making a film about one of the Bluebirds' most colourful characters. Friday (The Greatest Player You Never Saw) is about the late Robin Friday, who played for Cardiff and Reading in the 1980s before he died aged 38. \"He made George Best look like an angel,\" Young said. \"We've put together finance for it and got some big stars in it and it looks like we'll be shooting it in England or Ireland later this summer.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Once upon a time, there was a bedtime story - and it was the start of a long career for TV and film producer Mike Young.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that can cause a fatal infection in people with weakened immune systems - particularly those with advanced HIV. Birds are known to carry the fungus, with experts puzzled why the birds themselves do not appear to become ill. Research has found a blood cell called a macrophage can block its growth. The fungus, found in bird's droppings, mostly infects the lungs or the central nervous system. Scientists at the University of Sheffield and the University of Birmingham found it can grow slowly within the bird's digestive tract, but if it tries to invade the bird's body the immune system immediately destroys it. Dr Simon Johnston, who led the research, said: \"Birds have a higher body temperature than humans, but this alone is not enough to fully stop the fungus. \"By studying bird cells under the microscope, we have seen that macrophage cells have the ability to completely block the growth of the fungus, which can be fatal in humans. He added: \"If we can learn how some animals are able to resist infection we might be able to gain insights into how we can improve the human immune response to this fungus.\" The universities said the work was part of a larger international effort to help fight cryptococcosis.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The \"great appendage\" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. \"The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record,\" he told BBC News. \"What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes.\" New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. \"People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones,\" added Dr Edgecombe. \"By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals.\" Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: \"It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail.\" She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see \"the concentrated neural structures in the head region\". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for \"large claws\". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy came together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. \"We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions,\" said Prof Strausfeld. \"This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian.\" He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. \"Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages.\" The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

According to their passports, that currently makes Mr Chand 106 and his wife 99 years old. They wed in a typical Sikh ceremony in December 1925 and have just celebrated their 86th year together as a married couple, which they think may qualify them as the UK's longest married husband and wife. Mr Chand, who came with his family to Bradford in 1965, said there was no real secret to living a long married life. \"Eat and drink what you want but in moderation. I have never held back from enjoying my life,\" he said. Mr Chand smokes one cigarette a day before his evening meal and also drinks a tot of whiskey or brandy three or four times a week. His daughter-in-law Rani said it was something he looked forward to. The couple have eight children, 27 grandchildren and 23 great grandchildren. Many Asian people in the UK live within traditional extended families and the Chands are no exception. They live with their youngest son Satpal, together with his wife and two of their four children. \"We really feel blessed that our parents are still here with us and every day is a bonus,\" Satpal said. \"I think that keeping the minds of older people active is the key to them staying alert and healthy. \"If you have been given the privilege to look after your parents you must involve them fully in family life and never get angry with them, keep them happy and they will then look forward to getting up the next morning.\" Kartari Chand is looking forward to getting a letter from The Queen later this year when she celebrates her 100th birthday, but is more cautious about staying fit and healthy. \"We have always eaten good wholesome food, there's nothing artificial in our diet but things like ghee (clarified butter), milk and fresh yogurt are what we like. \"We know that being married for 86 years is a blessing, but equally we will be ready to go when it's time, it's all up to the will of God, but we really have lived a good life.\" Mrs Chand said that she and her husband enjoyed doing many things, such as eating meals together and going to the temple. However, she said some aspects of old age were difficult. \"My eldest son died and that was hard for us because you don't expect to outlive your own children. \"We have seen many other close family members depart and that's something we just have to live with.\" Mr Chand is now unable to walk any distance without assistance and needs a lot more care than his wife, who remains active and still has her own teeth.

But he looked back to something like his best at Lord's with 2-16 from a six-over spell as England recovered from 30-4 to reach 85-4 after Australia had declared on 566-8. \"Nothing's changed for me. It's always nice to go out there and perform and to bowl at good pace,\" Johnson added. \"The ball's been swinging over here too and I've really enjoyed that. When the ball swings at good pace it makes it a little more difficult.\" He also appeared to make light of England's talk of playing a more attacking style of cricket under new coach Trevor Bayliss. \"We were hoping they would come out and play the aggressive brand they've been talking about,\" he said. \"We hope they come out in the morning and do the same thing.\" And he added: \"I guess Ben Stokes is a very aggressive player anyway so we'd like to see him play some shots and hopefully get a couple of quick wickets in the morning. \"I can't decide for them, if they want to play aggressive cricket or if they want to go the other way.\" England paceman Stuart Broad, who took four for 83 in Australia's first innings, accepted his side had succumbed to the pressure of the tourists' huge total. \"It's always a tricky period when you've conceded a lot of runs to then go out and bat for 30 overs,\" he said. \"It's always a big test for you and I think mentally we didn't switch on for 20 minutes - and lost four wickets. \"We'll have a few batsmen in that changing room wishing they could face their balls again and play them pretty differently, I think.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Fast bowler Mitchell Johnson says Australia's attack can reopen the scars of England's batting struggles from their 5-0 Ashes whitewash down under.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The Norwegian,  who also won the sixth stage of the race in Lisieux, proved the strongest of a breakaway group of 14 riders over the stage's final climb. Frenchman Thomas Voeckler ended an eighth day in yellow, but conceded 27 seconds to his main rivals. Australian Cadel Evans is his nearest challenger - one minute 18 seconds behind with four stages to go. Manx sprinter Mark Cavendish put in another solid shift, picking up a point at the intermediate checkpoint and retaining his green jersey. Team Sky's strong showing in the absence of team leader Bradley Wiggins, who suffered a broken collarbone on stage seven, has also made it a successful Tour for the only British team in the race. Rigoberto Uran and Geraint Thomas have both held the jersey for the race's best young rider, while Boasson Hagen is emerging as a consistent threat at the end of each stage. The 24-year-old played his part in a 14-strong breakaway that established an advantage of more than seven minutes over the peloton as they climbed the category-two Col de Montgenevre. Irishman Nicolas Roche attempted in vain to lead a group of three across the gap as the field climbed over the border and up to the Italian resort of Sestriere. But, with any gains immediately at risk on a subsequent 48km descent, the general classification contenders were content to save their aggression for Pramartino - the stage's final ascent. After breaking free at the head of the field, Spaniard Ruben Perez Moreno reached Sestriere with a clear lead and raced solo downhill in a bold attempt to win from the front. With 20km to go, the lone leader's lead of over a minute was still intact but he was absorbed back into the chasing pack as they climbed for the final time. French champion Sylvain Chavanel initially took on the pace but he could not shake Boasson Hagen who powered away before nervelessly navigating the winding downhill roads to Pinerolo for his victory. \"If I'd taken fewer risks, I would have finished with Contador, Evans and the Schlecks Back in the field, Alberto Contador tested Andy Schleck and Voeckler with a burst of acceleration. But the descent proved more profitable for the Spaniard as Voeckler lost crucial time running wide on the corner as he struggled to keep with the downhill pace. Contador, a three-time winner, and his compatriot Samuel Sanchez looked as if they may make inroads into the rest of their rivals as they pressed in the final kilometres. But Andy Schleck, who had looked nervous in wet weather on the way down to La Rochette on Tuesday, brother Frank and Evans stuck doggedly to their tail to record the same time. Contador confirmed that, after getting caught up in a pile-up on the first stage and suffering a knee injury earlier in the race, he had to take some risks in a bid to win a fourth Tour de France. \"It was a very dangerous descent,\" he said. \"I was off the front, I saw I could attack and the important thing is to pull back time every day.\" And Voeckler revealed that Contador's approach was at least a partial success, convincing him to ride unnecessarily aggressively in the closing stages. \"It's a pity, because I saw that Contador, Evans and the Schlecks finished together,\" reflected Voeckler. \"If I'd taken fewer risks, I would have finished with them.\" STAGE 17 RESULT 1 Edvald Boasson Hagen (Nor/Team Sky) 4hrs 18mins 00secs 2 Bauke Mollema (Ned/Rabobank) at 0:40 3 Sandy Casar (Fra/FDJ)  at 0:50 4 Julien El Fares (Fra/Cofidis) same time 5 Sylvain Chavanel (Fra/Quickstep) 6 Dmitriy Fofonov (Kaz/Astana)  at 1:10 7 Maciej Paterski (Pol/Liquigas) 8 Dmitriy Muravyev (Kaz/RadioShack) 9 Jonathan Hivert (Fra/Saur-Sojasun)  at 1:15 10 Borut Bozic (Slo/Vacansoleil) at 2:20 OVERALL STANDINGS 1.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Speaking to reporters, FBI boss James Comey said the plans to enable encryption by default could thwart law enforcement investigations. Lives could depend on police forces continuing to get access to the data on devices used by criminals and terrorists, he said. The FBI was talking to both Apple and Google about its fears, said Mr Comey. The conversations with tech firms needed to be had before the day when police forces lost access to those devices, he said. \"I'd hate to have people look at me and say, 'Well how come you can't save this kid?' 'How come you can't do this thing?'\" said Mr Comey in a briefing. His comments came in reaction to a decision by Apple to enable a file encryption system on its iOS 8 software for which it has no keys. This means it would not be able to comply with any official request to help police get at the data on those devices. Google has said it too is planning to enable a similar encryption system by default on the next version of Android. Mr Comey said he was \"very concerned\" about these plans because of what they would allow people to do. \"What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law,\" he said. \"I am a huge believer in the rule of law, but I am also a believer that no-one in this country is beyond the law,\" he added.

{"article": "###\nArticle: US academics have produced international comparisons in key subjects - using tests taken in 2011 by 900,000 pupils in over 60 countries. It shows that Northern Ireland is Europe's top performing education system for primary maths. England has slipped in science, but is top 10 for primary and secondary maths. The top places in this global education league table have been taken by Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. Finland is among the highest placed European countries. Such comparisons have become increasingly influential - measuring pupils against the standards of international competitor countries. Globalisation in the jobs market and the economy has seen education ministers wanting to benchmark pupils' achievement against current international rivals. Such international rankings have also highlighted the educational strength underpinning the emerging economic powers in Asia. These latest rankings bring together two major studies - the four-yearly Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the five-yearly Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). They reveal the continuing pattern of domination by a group of Asian education systems - South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong (such international comparisons include regional school systems as well as countries). But the study, compiled by researchers at Boston College in the US, shows that England and Northern Ireland are performing strongly in the following group of European education systems. Source: TIMSS 2011 In maths, the study says England has been one of the most improved between 1995 and 2011. England remains in the global top 10 for maths - in 9th for primary and 10th for secondary. England has slipped in primary science tests, taken by 600,000 10 year olds - down to 15th place from 7th place in the last tests in 2007. There was also a dip for secondary science, taken by 14 year olds, down from 5th to 9th place. In the literacy tests, taken by a sample of 325,000 primary school pupils, there was progress for England - up from 15th to 11th. A spokesman for Education Secretary Michael Gove said: \"These tests reflect progress between 2006 and 2011 and were taken only a year after the election. \"So to the limited extent the results reflect the effect of political leadership, Labour deserves the praise for the small improvement in reading and the blame for the stagnation in maths and the decline in science. The tests say nothing, good or bad, about what we have done.\" Labour's education spokesman, Stephen Twigg, said: \"These results show schools in England are some of the best in Europe - thanks to the hard work of teachers and pupils. The Labour government's reforms saw reading results improve thanks to better teaching, smaller class sizes and Labour's National Literacy Strategy. Source: TIMSS 2011 \"However, we need to understand why East Asian countries out perform us in key skills - particularly science and maths.\" Mr Twigg also highlighted the lower achievement for Sweden in reading - linking it to the free schools inspired by the Swedish education system. There was a particularly strong performance for Northern Ireland - in 6th place for primary maths, which meant it was the highest ranking European school system. Northern Ireland, taking part in these tests for the first time, is in 5th place for primary reading - in a top group alongside such education superpowers such as Finland and Hong Kong. In terms of the proportion of pupils reaching the highest ability levels, Northern Ireland was even more successful, in 3rd place. The maths study also ranked the \"safe and orderly\" levels of schools - and found Northern Ireland was at the top, with England in 14th place. There was also a ranking of bullying for the primary maths study - with England having one of the worst records in Europe, in 30th place in terms of students' views of the levels of bullying. Scotland and Wales did not take part in these rankings. Such results show long-term trends, overlapping between different governments and education ministers. In England, the tests were taken under the current coalition government, but the pupils would have studied under the reforms of the previous Labour government. Source: PIRLS 2011 Researchers say the factors linked to success are a supportive home background and schools which have good discipline and experienced and well-motivated teachers. They also mention negative social factors, such as too many older pupils having learning impaired by a lack of adequate sleep. The maths study examined the availability of resources at home - such as books - with pupils in South Korea, Norway, Sweden and the US being the best equipped. Indonesia and Ghana had the least learning materials at home. There is a broad pattern repeated across these tables, with a cluster of Asian, Pacific Rim, countries at the top, European and western countries in the upper and middle ranks, with countries in North Africa and the Middle East in the lower ranks. Report author and Boston College professor, Michael Martin, said that the success of the top-performing countries reflects the long-term investment - and shows the way for other developing countries to follow. \"Education is a multi-generational enterprise,\" he said. \"One thing you can learn from these is what's possible. That comes as a shock sometimes, what students in other countries can actually do and the gap sometimes between what your students are achieving and what students in other countries are achieving,\" said Prof Martin. There are other international rankings - but these also show a similar picture at the top of the table, with education systems such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Finland and England among the highest performers. In global league tables assembled by Pearson last month, Finland and South Korea were top, with England in 6th place. The less expected success of the TIMSS and PIRLS rankings will be the high performance of Russia, which has a place in all their top 10s. Another prominent international ranking, the PISA tests run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has shown a strong performance for Chinese education systems, including Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Asian countries have taken top places in global school rankings for maths, science and reading, with England and Northern Ireland among high performers.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Smylie Kaufman will play with his fellow American on Sunday, with former champion Bernhard Langer and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama a further shot behind. McIlroy, 26, started the day one behind Spieth, but ended five back after a 77. The Northern Irishman started his third round with genuine hopes of winning the Green Jacket after a late rally on Friday. But his bid to become only the sixth man to win all four majors suffered following a birdie-free round featuring three bogeys and one double bogey which left him in a tie for 11th place. McIlroy will tee off at 18:55 BST on Sunday, with the final pairing of Spieth and Kaufman going out at 19:45. Sunday's tee-off times Relive Saturday's third round at Augusta Media playback is not supported on this device Saturday was billed as a showdown between the final pairing of Spieth and McIlroy, but the expected battle between golf's youthful poster boys failed to materialise. World number three McIlroy struggled to find his rhythm throughout, allowing Spieth to take control without the defending champion being at his fluent best. But while McIlroy was unable to pick up any shots, blowing a decent chance at the last by pushing wide a nine-foot putt, his rival still managed to grind out five birdies. However, Spieth's card suffered considerably with two rare double bogeys. The Texan three-putted on the 505-yard, par-four 11th, offering hope to his nearest challengers who, at this stage, were Matsuyama and Langer. He rectified that sloppy mistake with three birdies in the next four holes, opening up another four-stroke lead over 24-year-old Kaufman, who had emerged from the pack with three birdies of his own in the final six holes. But Spieth's poor final hole - driving right into the trees before falling 50 foot short of the pin with an undercooked third shot - gave renewed belief to the rest of the leaderboard. \"Two under with three to go and the wind at your side, I just got really wayward from there,\" said Spieth. \"I just have to absolutely throw away the finish to this round, pretend it's a new round, everyone is tied and you have to shoot the best score to win. \"I have to understand it's the position I wanted to be in after 54 holes and not think about the finish to this round.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Spieth had earlier extended his lead with a two-putt birdie on the par-five second, where McIlroy had to settle for a par after missing from nine feet. McIlroy dropped his first shot on the par-four third, whereas Spieth recovered from a wayward drive to save par and extend his lead to three. By the turn, the world number two was four shots ahead, before McIlroy's challenge faded when he pulled tee-shots at 10 and 11 on his way to dropping three shots. That may have all but ended his Masters quest for another year, despite the four-time major winner arresting his decline with seven straight pars on his way back to the clubhouse. \"I couldn't get anything going really,\" McIlroy said. \"I am disappointed. I felt like I righted the ship a little on the back nine but couldn't take the few opportunities I gave myself. \"If I am to take heart from anything then it's the fact Jordan has just let a lot of people in after his finish.\" While Spieth and McIlroy struggled to impress, it was a player at the other end of his career who threatened to steal the show. Former world number one Langer, who won the Green Jacket in 1985 and 1993, was five shots adrift of overnight leader Spieth at the start of Saturday's third round. But the veteran German carded three birdies in a front-nine 35 to make the biggest progress on 'Moving Day' - the penultimate day of a major where contenders on the fringes know they must perform well. Langer dropped a shot on the iconic par-three 12th, but bounced back with three straight birdies to take a share of second place with Matsuyama. A loose tee-shot out right on the 18th left him scrambling, but he managed to limit the damage by holing a tricky seven-foot putt for bogey. The Augusta galleries showed their appreciation for the unlikely challenger, now ranked 1,080 in the world, with a standing ovation. \"I believe I can win. Obviously it depends how the others do,\" said Langer. \"If I play my best, I can shoot four or five under tomorrow, I think, if the conditions are a little bit better.\" Media playback is not supported on this device The world's best golfers struggled to tame Augusta in a testing third round caused by winds gusting up to 30mph. Only five of the 57-man field managed to finish under par, Kaufman carding the best round of the day with a three-under 69. But the course was described as \"brutal\" by another American, Kevin Kisner, who shot a 76. \"Every shot is just guessing and hitting and praying. I never felt comfortable even on wedge shots all day and putts are just brutal,\" he said. \"I watched [playing partner] Justin Thomas hit a four-footer that went 55 feet. I mean you don't see that stuff.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham says he is \"struggling\" with whether UK action would be legal or not. So what are the key legal questions? Parliament has already rejected military intervention in Syria, in 2013. Ministers say circumstances have changed since then (notably with the rise of IS) and that they would only proceed this time with the backing of Parliament. But this is not technically necessary. Although it has become convention since the 2003 Iraq war, there is no legal requirement for Parliamentary approval for military action. Ministers say they would not proceed without a Commons vote - but they believe they have the authority, under international law, to intervene. Last month, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said there was \"no legal bar\" to the UK operating in Syria. In September, David Cameron suggested the UK could legally take military action in Syria without a request from President Assad, saying the Syrian president is \"illegitimate\". The UK is already carrying out air strikes on IS targets in Iraq. The UK says that as the Iraqi government requested intervention, this provides a \"clear and unequivocal legal basis\" for the military action. But no such request has been received from the Syrian government, and the UK sees the regime as illegitimate in any case. This means the legal arguments around intervention in Syria would be shaped by the complexities and conflicting interpretations of international law. The UN Charter bans \"the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\" unless used in self-defence or authorised by a UN resolution. Those are the two \"classic justifications\" for military action, Prof Philippe Sands QC of University College London told the BBC. A UN resolution is unlikely given Russian opposition, leaving the option of self-defence. This would require ministers to show military action was needed to prevent attacks on the UK or its citizens emanating from Syria. Alternatively, the self-defence argument could be used in relation to Iraq, which has already requested military assistance. This is the argument used by the United States, which is carrying out air strikes in Syria. As to whether this would work, \"we simply do not know enough about the facts\" to say definitely whether the self-defence argument is justified, says Prof Sands. He believes it would be \"a bit of a stretch\" on the basis of what is publicly available, adding that the UK appears to have \"no strategy and no clear basis of information to explain to the public what it is doing, and why it believes it is entitled in law to use force by way of self-defence\". Another option would be to justify the action on humanitarian grounds. This was the basis of the government's case for intervention in 2013, when it focused on the possible use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Assad. Its legal position, published in August 2013, set out the three conditions that had to be met: \"This puts the evidential bar both high and wide,\" BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman wrote at the time. The question would be whether the changed circumstances, with IS - also known as ISIS - militants controlling parts of Syria and fighting against government forces, would meet the test. Dr Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC there would be a \"quite plausible case\". \"Given the behaviour we know of ISIS, the circumstances of the horrific civil war in Syria, it's not difficult to construct a case that the humanitarian danger is grave and is immediate,\" he says. As well as the UN rules, \"customary international law\" has been established over the years. One option would be the right of \"hot pursuit\" of IS across borders, Dr Eyal says. Given that Iraq has requested international assistance in the fight against IS militants, the UK could argue that unless it can pursue them into Syria, they could \"seek refuge across the border and the situation will never end\", he says. This argument is strengthened by the inability of the Syria government to control its own territory he says, adding that hot pursuit is \"not an argument that lawyers are very comfortable with, but it has been made before\". No. Both the hot pursuit and humanitarian intervention arguments are \"controversial and contested\", Dr Eyal says, with governments accused of \"abusing the system\". Some legal experts are not convinced any air strikes without specific Security Council authorisation would be consistent with international law, a Commons briefing paper points out. Sort of. A US-led coalition is already carrying out air strikes in Syria. Last month it emerged UK pilots had been embedded with coalition forces and conducting air strikes over Syria against IS. Amid criticism from Labour, Mr Fallon said embedding forces was \"standard practice\" and their engagement was not a \"British military operation\". Very much so. The government's insistence on securing Parliamentary approval means it will be MPs' interpretations of these intricacies of international law that will be key. Last time MPs debated military intervention in Syria, opposition from backbench Conservatives and Ed Miliband-led Labour was enough to defeat the government. However, MPs have since overwhelmingly backed action in Iraq, where the target was IS militants. Since those votes, the make-up of the Commons has changed, with the Conservatives holding a majority. The identity of Labour's next leader - with surprise frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn certain to oppose any air strikes - is another complicating factor.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "One of the big questions facing MPs after the summer recess could be whether to authorise military intervention against so-called Islamic State (IS) extremists in Syria.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It is caused by women taking legal and illegal drugs while pregnant. Health experts say it is a declining trend. BBC's Look North and the English regions data unit asked NHS hospital trusts to provide details about the number of babies born who were addicted to drugs between 2011 and 2015. The figures show a wide geographical variation in the number of newborns who were dependent on harmful substances. One in 100 babies born at Bedford Hospital in 2015 displayed signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome.  In contrast, Leicester General had one of the lowest rates with one in every 5,000 babies born addicted to a harmful substance. In Leeds, around one in 250 babies was born with the condition. Lisa Batty, 37, from Bradford, gave birth to four children who were addicted to heroin. \"I didn't care that my kids were addicted to drugs, I was more concerned about where I was getting my next fix from. I know it's selfish but that's how it felt at the time,\" she said. \"I remember visiting my children in hospital as they suffered withdrawal symptoms from the methadone they were being given as part of their treatment. I remember seeing them trembling and shaking in their cots. I admit I was a bad mum but I've turned my life around now\". Lisa has now recovered from drug addiction and has become involved with the charity Narcotics Anonymous to help others. The data for England also shows that over the past four years there has been general decline in the number of babies being diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Those working to treat mothers and babies with a drug addiction say the majority of parents they deal with come from a disadvantaged socio-economic background, with most cases involving an abuse of drugs like heroin, cocaine or alcohol. Susan Flynn is a specialist midwife in Leeds who helps treat mothers who have a drug addiction. \"I have seen the numbers begin to fall slightly in the past three years,\" she said. \"I don't think we can say there is one single reason for the decline but maybe the message is getting out there that it's not right to take drugs or alcohol whilst you're pregnant. \"There are of course people who say that women who take drugs whilst they're pregnant should have their children removed from them, but for me I believe everyone should have the chance to turn their life around.\" Liz Butcher, from Public Health England in Yorkshire and the Humber, said: 'It is particularly important pregnant women  who use drugs get supportive, collaborative care to reduce the risks to the health of their babies. \"Many places in the region have specialist staff and well-established training to make sure that happens.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Almost one in 500 babies in hospitals in England is born dependent on substances their mother took while pregnant, a BBC investigation has found.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Several species' vision was studied by an international team to identify this ultra-violet (UV) sensitivity. The findings, published in the journal Conservation Biology, claimed habitats and migration could be disrupted. The flashes, or corona, occur when charge builds up in a cable and is released into the air. The international team, including scientists from University College London and the Arctic University of Norway, measured the spectrum of light emitted by these bursts of charge. They worked out that although the light was invisible to us, it contained wavelengths seen by many other mammals. \"Most mammals will let some [UV light] into their eye,\" explained UCL vision expert Prof Glen Jeffery, one of the lead researchers in this project. \"We're weird - us and monkeys - because we don't see UV. Most animals do.\" The first animal to reveal its UV sensitivity was the reindeer. And, as the researchers explained, reindeers' avoidance of the power lines running across the Arctic tundra was part of the inspiration for this project. Dr Nicholas Tyler, the other lead author, said it had been assumed that rather than avoiding the power cables themselves, animals steered clear of passages cut in forested areas before pylons were installed. \"Forest animals will not cross clear-cuts,\" he said. \"But for us in the Arctic, avoidance of power lines is difficult to explain - there are no trees, yet the reindeer still avoid the power lines.\" The animals keep as much as 5km (3 miles) from either side of the cables. \"This has been a mystery,\" Dr Tyler added. \"We have now come up with a mechanism [to explain it].\" This research required a detailed understanding of animal vision, which was where Prof Jeffery came in. Having discovered in 2011 that reindeer eyes were sensitive to UV light, Prof Jeffery went on to study the eyes of almost 40 mammal species, revealing all were UV-sensitive. Since, as the researchers added, coronas \"happen on all power lines everywhere\", the avoidance of the flashes could be having a global impact on wildlife. \"It has always been assumed that power lines - masts and the cables strung between them - were passive structures standing immobile in the terrain, and therefore inoffensive for animals,\" said Dr Tyler. \"As a result of this work, we now consider them as chains of flashing light stretching across the tundra in the winter darkness, and that's why the animals find them so offensive.\" The random and unpredictable nature of these flashes were particularly problematic, he added, as the animals could not easily adapt to them. Prof Jeffery said he hoped power companies would now consider ways to address the issue.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Animals around the world could be scared away from power cables because these give off UV flashes invisible to humans, scientists have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Alesha O'Connor, Rhodri Miller, Corey Price, all 17 and from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, and Margaret Challis, 66, from Merthyr Tydfil, were killed near Storey Arms, Brecon, in March 2015. The Aberdare inquest heard Rhodri was driving the teenagers in one car. The coroner concluded all four died as a result of a road traffic accident. The inquest was told Rhodri's car was one of seven vehicles in a convoy going on a drive from Barry on the night of 6 March. Rhys Hunter, a passenger in the car, said Rhodri had passed his test a few days earlier. He said before the group set off someone warned him \"be careful, we're on a mountain\" and at one point during the journey the driver ran a red light. Minutes before the crash, Mr Hunter took a picture and the speedometer in the car he was in showed 75 mph (120km/h). But Mr Hunter said Rhodri was not trying to catch up with the vehicle in front of him and had not been trying to overtake another vehicle. \"Rhodri started to lose control and we collided with the other car,\" he said. \"I'm not sure why it happened or why the car was out of control. Probably because of the way it was driven.\" Joseph Fetter, who was driving behind Rhodri's car, said he was driving consistently around five car lengths behind and no racing had taken place, but he had seen Rhodri's brake lights come on several times. \"I think it was inexperience that made him lose control,\" he said. \"I wasn't pushing him on - I didn't know the road at all. It was dark.\" Passengers in some of the other vehicles said Rhodri was not overtaking but did lose control of his car on the bend, swerving from one side of the road to the other. But survivor Emlyn Williams, who was in the other car involved in the crash along with friend Mrs Challis, disputed some of the evidence. \"The car was coming down by a bend. I saw another car overtaking it. The car hit me, that was it,\" he said. \"The only thing I knew was a bang, the windscreen broke and the airbag came out. \"I tried to get out and see to Mrs Challis. I went to the other car. It was quiet, silent. There was no opportunity to steer out of the way.\" Drivers and passengers in vehicles travelling in the direction of Merthyr Tydfil described in police statements seeing the cars leave a lay-by at Storey Arms minutes before the collision. The inquest was told they pulled out too quickly and too close to each other. One witness said: \"Boy racers. It's obvious they were on a mission.\" Dyfed-Powys Police Insp Gary Jones told the inquest messages found on mobile phones showed those in the convoy had discussed speed. One read: \"It's madness. Everyone's racing there are 9 cars\" while another read \"why would I want to go along cars with turbos - I'll be the slowest there\". PC David Stacey, who investigated what had happened, said it was \"like nothing I had seen in 20 years service. It was a distressing scene\". He told the inquest he believed what Mr Williams had seen was Rhodri's car out of control, possibly caused by approaching the unmarked bend at too high a speed and braking in the turn, but not overtaking. Rhodri and Corey were pronounced dead at the scene while Alesha and Mrs Challis died at Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr. The inquest heard new road signs had since been put in place on that section of road but the coroner recommended that signage should warn about the upcoming bend. In a statement, Rhodri's family described their son as \"the child every parent would dream of\", adding: \"Our hearts have been ripped out, and nothing is the same.\" The family said they would like to see lessons learned and for young drivers to be made to realise the implications of serious car accidents in the same way as those who are caught speeding do.

World number six Kei Nishikori brought the visitors level with a 6-3 7-5 7-6 (7-3) win over Dan Evans in Birmingham. Victory in the best-of-five first-round tie will secure a quarter-final place and World Group status in 2017. Dom Inglot and Jamie Murray are scheduled to take on Yoshihito Nishioka and Yasutaka Uchiyama in Saturday's doubles contest, although the line-ups can change up to an hour before the 14:00 GMT start time. \"We will wait and see,\" GB captain Leon Smith told BBC Sport. \"[It will be] hopefully our strongest team, put it that way.\" Britain are defending the title they regained last November for the first time in 79 years with victory against Belgium. \"It was amazing,\" Murray said of the reception he received after needing only 90 minutes to see off Daniel. Media playback is not supported on this device There were signs of rustiness - four double faults and 25 unforced errors slowing his progress at times - but the Scot broke serve six times and saved both break points he faced in a one-sided win. Murray, 28, won the opening 11 points in his first match since losing to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final 33 days ago. He wrapped up the first set in 28 minutes and took hold of a more competitive second after a double fault at 3-3 from Daniel, the US-born 23-year-old with just five ATP wins to his name. Two blistering returns gave Murray the decisive break at the start of the third and he wrapped up the 28th Davis Cup singles win of his career in style. \"The last few weeks have been the best of my life, really special,\" Murray said of becoming a father to Sophia. \"It has been tough the last few days being away from her for the first time but it had to happen to some stage, and it is a pleasure to represent my country and be with team-mates that we won with last year. \"The second set was tough - a lot of close games and some tough points, which was good for me. \"I was getting a little out of breath but I played a good match, served well, missed a few second serves but the first serve went extremely well, so it was a nice start.\" Evans, from Solihull, had the support of his home crowd and the confidence from a victory in his only previous meeting with Nishikori, but the Japanese player was still too strong. It is over three years since he surprisingly lost to Evans at the US Open and Nishikori has since become established among the game's elite. Evans, 25, once again played above his ranking of 157 but could only convert four of 13 break points that came his way. After dropping serve twice in the first set he failed to capitalise on 0-40 early on in what proved to be a tight second. Both players missed break point chances and a tie-break loomed with the Briton serving at 6-5, but after saving two set points he then netted a volley and double faulted. With both men apparently tiring, the third set saw a rash of service breaks - six in eight games - with Evans unable to build on leads at 3-2 and 4-3. Nishikori, 26, was similarly vulnerable on his own serve but got himself across the line in the tie-break after two hours and 44 minutes. Andy Murray slipped fairly seamlessly back into the day job, but Kei Nishikori had to absorb a lot of pressure from Dan Evans to make sure the tie is level heading into Saturday's doubles. But who will play? Murray told me he \"would love to play if it's the best thing for the team,\" as long as his body feels fine in the morning. But will Nishikori be on the other side of the court? It is looking likely - even though he has only ever played two Davis Cup doubles matches for Japan. \"He missed a few balls and looked a bit rusty but overall you've got to give Andy a 9/10. He just wanted to feel the ball out there but he looked sharp, and will be looking forward to the big match against Nishikori on Sunday. \"Nishikori got very nervous against Evans for a while there, but in the end the class player came through and upped his game.\" Friday Andy Murray beats Taro Daniel 6-1 6-3 6-1 Kei Nishikori beats Dan Evans 6-3 7-5 7-6 (7-3) Saturday doubles Dominic Inglot & Jamie Murray v Yoshihito Nishioka & Yasutaka Uchiyama Sunday Andy Murray v Kei Nishikori Dan Evans v Taro Daniel Listen to State of the British Game - a 5 live sport special\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Andy Murray returned to action with a comfortable win as Great Britain ended day one of their Davis Cup defence tied at 1-1 against Japan in Birmingham.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

However, Dr Ley agreed that he exhibited \"narcissistic\", \"histrionic\" and \"self-centred\" traits, adding that it was unlikely he would ever have complete resolution of his illness. Another expert, consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph, said he was satisfied on all the evidence he had seen that Mr Daley was not psychotic at the time of the killing. Jurors also head from Mr Daley's father, who said his son had never been a violent person. John Daley described him as a \"nice guy\" who was affectionate to his family and animals. He said Mr Daley was \"scrupulously honest in all his dealings with others, honest to a fault in that he finds it difficult to lie about things\". He told the court that he first became worried about his son's mental health when he reported hearing voices. Mr Daley said he started a journal, partly to keep track of his son's treatment. \"The second reason for having the document was, as time went on, it was clear that Matthew's life expectations were draining away and I didn't want to be in my 80s and look back saying, 'What did I do'?\" The trial continues.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A man who stabbed a motorist 39 times after a crash was misdiagnosed with a form of autism, a court has been told.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Although the Vale of Rheidol line no longer carries lead ore from the mines, as it did between 1902 and the 1930s, it does carry tourists from the seaside town of Aberystwyth to nearby Devil's Bridge. Its workshop, near Aberystwyth railway station, restores locomotives for museums and railways across the UK - and has recently been commissioned to create new wheels for the town's cliff railway which takes visitors up Constitution Hill. \"These are the sort of things you can't learn in college, you have to learn on the job,\" Will Smith, operations and safety officer, said. \"So you'll find the railway itself is operated by quite a young staff, so it bucks the trend for the tourist railways and safeguards it for the next generation. \"It's an interesting place to work, no two days are the same. You get to meet thousands of interesting visitors and everybody's here to have a good day out.\" Mr Smith said since 1902 the railway, which has always included a passenger service, had only stopped operating once - during World War Two. \"Pretty much everything in the country shut down,\" he said. \"As part of the war effort it stopped operation, but I'm told the day the war ended they steamed the engine up and blew the whistle all the way down the line. \"Someone said that was their first memory of the railway.\" Simon Cowan, carriage and locomotive painter, is trained as a fireman and a driver. \"The main thing is to make things from scratch, to replace items which are no longer made,\" he said. \"So we copy them faithfully and make them all in the old fashioned way and then I pass these skills on to other people, it's a bit like a big museum. \"It's the older people, I'm one of them, who have grown up in that specialist knowledge, that area, passing those skills on - because I will get to the point where I can't do this any more. \"I show people how to paint, it's a lovely way of seeing people develop, so when I go on holiday I'm not thinking 'gosh what are they doing to my paint shop'. \"We also put them out on the trains as firemen and guards, and we teach them as much as we can. \"Carriages are painted with 24 carat gold leaf and they go 'wow that must be so expensive', well no it's so wafer thin. \"We show them how to make a tracing of a word and get the typeface correct and show them how to apply the lettering on to a piece of wood, and then we'll use this varnish and paint that on to there, and when the varnish is sticky put the gold leaf on and peel it off and 'wow, that's great'. \"Then I'll say 'give us your thumb' and put a bit of varnish on, just let that dry, and gold leaf their thumb and they think it's hilarious - but then they've learnt how to do it.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) made its latest claims two days before Russia finds out whether it can send athletes to the 2016 Rio Olympics. They were banned from international competition after Wada accused Russia of state-sponsored doping. Athletics chiefs meet on Friday to decide whether to lift the ban. It says that: The report details the lengths athletes from different sports allegedly went to, both to avoid tests and fool doping control officers (DCOs). It says one athlete was seen running away from the mixed zone after an event, while another left the stadium during a race and could not be located. Wada also highlighted the case of an athlete who, it says, used a container - \"presumably containing clean urine\" - that had been inserted inside her. When she tried to use the container, it leaked onto the floor. The athlete is alleged to have tried to bribe the DCO before providing a sample that subsequently returned an adverse finding. The report also says that: As a result, tests were not carried out at the national weightlifting and national Greco-Roman wrestling championships. In some cases, testers were not told where an event was taking place. \"What really comes through, when you read through it page by page by page, is the number of occasions when there was simply no co-operation given,\"  former Wada president Dick Pound told the BBC World Service. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to suspend Russia's athletics federation on 13 November after an independent Wada report alleged \"state-sponsored doping\". The report was commissioned to investigate claims made in a documentary shown by German broadcaster ARD in 2014. The programme alleged widespread doping in Russian athletics, claiming as many as 99% of athletes had cheated. The claims were made by whistleblowers, among them Vitaly Stepanov, a former Russian anti-doping official, and his wife Yulia, a former 800m runner who was banned for doping. Russian athletes, including former London Marathon winner Liliya Shobukhova, also admitted to taking drugs and observing corruption. The Wada report found evidence of state involvement, as well as evidence that samples had been destroyed, doping controls had been interfered and bribes had been paid to conceal positive tests. Media playback is not supported on this device The IAAF meets on Friday in Vienna to discuss what Russian authorities have done to tackle doping and whether its athletes should compete in Rio. Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said the country could take legal action if its athletics federation was not reinstated, Interfax news agency has reported. \"It is a big and an important message whatever is decided,\" said Pound. \"If they are held to be excluded, that's a message. If they are allowed to come back in, there is going to be another message that all of the sporting authorities are going to have to deal with.\" Pound said a ban on Russian athletes competing in the Olympics would be extremely difficult for the Russian government to explain to its citizens. \"You can explain all sorts of economic sanctions and political sanctions and what not if you are the state,\" he said. \"But it is very hard to explain to a country that really enjoys its sport and likes to watch it why it is that nobody will play with you.\" Meanwhile, Russian Olympic medallists and world champions have appealed to the head of the International Olympic Committee to let athletes with no history of doping to compete at the Rio Games. \"The fraud of dishonest people should not jeopardise the career of innocent fellow athletes,\" said 13 sports stars in a letter to Thomas Bach.

He has denied receiving bribes in a scheme to divert funds from the state-run oil company Petrobras. About 50 Brazilian politicians, including the leader of the lower house of Congress, are under investigation in the Petrobras corruption scandal. Mr Santana is accused of receiving bribes from several large engineering conglomerates. Analysts say the charge against him is a further blow for President Rousseff who is facing impeachment proceedings. He was arrested in February after he returned from the Dominican Republic, where he was working on the re-election campaign of President Danilo Medina. Because of his proximity to her, the arrest is expected to damaged her standing further, even though impeachment proceedings against her are not related to the Petrobras corruption investigation. A former journalist, Mr Santana is well known for producing dramatic, big-budget campaign videos appealing to poorer voters. Mr Santana had called the accusations \"unfounded\".  And he had harsh words for the investigation, saying that Brazil was currently living in a \"climate of persecution\". If the investigating judge accepts the allegations against him, Mr Santana will be jailed. In Brasilia, a special Senate commission has begun hearings ahead of a vote on whether the whole Senate should take on impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff. A plenary Senate vote is widely expected to take place around 11 May. Across the country,  pro-government supporters blocked major roads in cities in nine Brazilian states during Thursday's morning rush-hour to call for the halt of impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff.

Investigators from 21 countries gathered at Interpol's headquarters in France in October to share information on suspects involved in a range of crimes involving the environment. Called Operation Infra Terra, the agency is now asking for assistance from the public in tracking down nine key suspects. \"Even the smallest detail, which you might think is insignificant, has the potential to break a case wide open when combined with other evidence the police already have,\" said Ioannis Kokkinis, from Interpol. \"Sometimes all it takes is a fresh pair of eyes to bring new momentum to an investigation and provide the missing clue which will help locate these wanted individuals, some of whom have been evading justice for years,\" he added.

He is being sought in connection with the seizure of 314 ivory pieces, weighing well over two tonnes in Mombasa in June. Others on the list include Ahmed Kamran who was charged with an attempt to smuggle over 100 live animals, including giraffes and impalas, to Qatar on a military plane.

He had applied for residency in 2014, but had been informed in December 2016 that \"he had four weeks to leave the country\", police official Jonas Hysing said. He did not leave and, in February, was officially put on a wanted list. A few months earlier, it is claimed he had lost his job after falling asleep at work. He had been working in construction, and was employed by Pierre Svensson for several weeks late last year, helping on an asbestos removal project. Mr Akilov was, he said, \"a reserved person\". \"He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish,\" he told news agency AFP. Mr Akilov was also described as not being particularly religious. One has suggested he \"partied and drank\", which goes against strict Islamic doctrine. \"He never talked about politics or religion,\" one friend told Swedish daily Aftonbladet. \"He didn't pray five times a day from what I know.\" A co-worker agreed, telling news agency Reuters: \"He was like any normal guy.\" Online, it seems, it was a different story. His Facebook page - which has since been taken down - is linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing. He also liked a page called \"Friends of Libya and Syria\", which says it aims to expose \"terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals\" of the US, British and Arab \"dictatorships\". However, he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. Despite all this, Mr Akilov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services, who dismissed him as a \"marginal character\", apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The main suspect of ploughing a truck into a department store in central Stockholm, killing four people, had been denied residency in Sweden and had expressed sympathy for so-called Islamic State (IS), police and reports said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Anthony Knockaert headed wide early on but striker Baldock made no mistake shortly after, guiding Gaetan Bong's cross into the top corner. Helder Costa came closest to equalising just before the break but his long-range shot was tipped over by Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale. Wolves pressed late on with several corners but Brighton held on. Walter Zenga's Wolves went into the game having won just two of their past nine away league games with only one clean sheet and they conceded what turned out to be the winning goal after only 16 minutes. Full-back Bong whipped in a pinpoint cross which was headed home by Baldock for his third goal in three games as the Seagulls took control before the break. Top-scorer Glenn Murray almost doubled Brighton's lead early in the second half but his header was narrowly wide and a minute later Knockaert forced a fine save from Carl Ikeme with a long-range left-footed shot. Wolves committed men forward late on but, despite a succession of corner kicks in the dying minutes, Albion held on for victory and their eighth clean sheet in 13 games. Brighton manager Chris Hughton: \"It is very timely that Sam is in this form and I am very pleased for him. He's been good for us. \"He may not score too many with his head but he showed a desire to get across the defender. \"He is a team player, works hard for the team and he is at the right place at the right time.\" Wolves head coach Walter Zenga: \"It was a good game in my opinion but they scored and we didn't. We played at the same level as Brighton. \"We were in the game and there was no difference in the teams.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Mr Banks said ex-leader Nigel Farage was UKIP's \"biggest asset\" and should be \"engaged once again\". In a letter to current leader Paul Nuttall, he criticised UKIP's tactics in the Stoke Central by-election where Mr Nuttall failed to unseat Labour. He said the party had wrongly adopted a \"red UKIP\" strategy, copying Labour policies on the NHS. Mr Nuttall, who was elected in November, has vowed to attract disillusioned Labour voters to UKIP, and hoped to capitalise on Stoke voters' leanings towards Brexit in Thursday's by-election. But he lost to Labour's Gareth Snell by 2,620 votes, securing only a slight increase in UKIP's vote share. The current UKIP chairman, Paul Oakden, said after the Stoke result that it might be years before his party, which currently has one MP, can pick up another via a by-election. In his letter to Mr Nuttall, Leave.EU campaign chairman Mr Banks, who also used a Sunday Express article to threaten to walk away from UKIP unless his demands are met, repeated his offer to become chairman in order to make it an \"efficient, professional and ultimately electable party\". He said his first move would be to bring in a CEO from industry to oversee a new membership drive, install a new team of \"trained professional agents\" to focus on target seats and use input from the public to draw up new policies. Mr Banks also called for a return to the fold for Mr Farage, who quit as UKIP leader after the EU referendum saying he wanted his \"life back\". Mr Banks said his strategy would include \"engaging Nigel once again in UKIP - he is our biggest asset and needs to become energised with the party once again and work with you to deliver UKIP MPs\". He added: \"The party is at a crossroads. We have to be radical to become relevant once again.\" In his Sunday Express article, Mr Banks called for senior figures he said were part of a \"Tory cabal\" to be expelled, saying: \"These dullards aren't bringing in Tory votes, Stoke proved that, so what are they for?\" In response,  Patrick O'Flynn, an MEP and Mr Nuttall's principal political adviser, told the BBC's Sunday Politics that his advice would be: \"Donate and don't seek to dictate.\" He said Mr Oakden was an \"excellent\" chairman and said the Leave.EU campaign had hardly been a \"smooth-running brilliant machine\". \"I'm always happy if people who want to give money and support to our party want to stay in the party but I think the best donors donate and don't seek to dictate,\" he said. \"Of course if they are expert in certain fields people should listen to their views, but to have a donor telling the party leader who should be party chairman, that's a non-starter.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "UKIP donor Arron Banks has offered to become party chairman in order to bring about a \"total rebrand\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Once again, it was only Celtic who were able to pay substantial sums in transfer fees and, even then, manager Neil Lennon's focus in signing Leigh Griffiths and Stefan Johansen was not so much on results in the second half of the season but on preparing for next season's assault on the Champions League qualifying rounds. The motivation for the rest was not on forming any kind of challenge to the runaway reigning champions at the top but on securing a place in the top six by the time the Scottish Premiership splits into two for the final round of fixtures. Indeed, even more importantly, the thought of finishing in the second bottom spot, which this season comes with it the prospect of relegation via a play-off against a side from the Championship, led to a plethora of changes in the squads near the foot of the table. Key arrivals: Adam Rooney could not reproduce his Inverness Caledonian Thistle form with Birmingham City and Oldham Athletic, but the Irish striker has scored two in two games on his return to Scotland's top flight. Rooney's addition comes after Calvin Zola failed to become a regular starter following his arriving from Burton Albion in the summer. Manager Derek McInnes will hope that Shaleum Logan or Alan Tate, who had arrived from Brentford and Swansea City respectively, prove to be as classy in defence as Michael Hector, who has returned to the Reading bench after his loan at Pittodrie. In: Adam Rooney, forward (Oldham Athletic). Loan: Alan Tate, defender (Swansea City); Shaleum Logan, defender (Brentford) Out: Gregg Wylde, midfielder (St Mirren); Scott Ferries, midfielder (Ross County), Chris Clark, midfielder (Cove Rangers); Craig Duguid, defender. Loan ended: Michael Hector, defender (Reading). Loan: Josh Magennis, forward (St Mirren); Lawrence Shankland, forward (Dunfermline Athletic); Stephen O'Neill, midfielder (East Fife); Jamie Masson, midfielder (Elgin City); Danny Rogers, goalkeeper (Airdrieonians) Summer signing report card Pass: Barry Robson, midfielder (Sheffield United); Willo Flood, midfielder (Dundee United); Michael Hector, defender (Reading) Jury's out: Calvin Zola, forward (Burton Albion); Nicky Weaver, goalkeeper (Sheffield Wednesday); Lawrence Shankland, forward (Queen's Park) Fail: Gregg Wylde, midfielder (Bolton Wanderers) Key arrivals: With summer signings Teemu Pukki and Amido Balde having failed to match the strike rate of Norwich City-bound Gary Hooper, manager Neil Lennon can expect Leigh Griffiths to guarantee goals on the domestic front even if he only reproduces the form he showed while on loan with Hibernian. However, the big test will be whether a player who was in and out of the Wolves side in England's League One can make the step up to the Champions League stage next season. Stefan Johansen should prove to be an adequate replacement for Joe Ledley after the Wales international's departure to Crystal Palace once the Norway midfielder settles in Glasgow. In: Leigh Griffiths, forward (Wolves, undisclosed); Stefan Johansen, midfielder (Stromgodset, \u00a32m); Holmbert Aron Fridjonsson (Fram Reykjavic, \u00a3150,000) Out: Joe Ledley, midfielder (Crystal Palace, undisclosed); Mo Bangura, forward. Loan ended: Max Oberschmidt, goalkeeper (Fulham). Loan: Tom Rogic, midfielder (Melbourne Victory); Dylan McGeough, midfielder (Coventry City); Bahrudin Atajic, forward (Shrewsbury Town); Jo Chalmers, defender (Falkirk); Stuart Findlay, defender (Morton); Paul George, midfielder (Hamilton Academical); Michael Miller, defender (Dumbarton) Summer signing report card Pass: Virgil van Dijk, defender (Groningen, \u00a32.6m) Jury's out: Steven Mouyokolo, defender (Wolves); Derk Boerrigter, midfielder (Ajax, \u00a33m); Nir Biton, midfielder (Ashdod, \u00a3700,000); Amido Balde, forward (Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es, \u00a31.5m); Teemu Pukki, forward (Schalke 04, undisclosed) Key arrivals: Dundee United thought they had pulled off the coup of the summer by bringing David Goodwillie back on loan from Blackburn Rovers. However, the troubled Scotland striker was kept out of the side by a combination of Nadir Ciftci, the young Turk who arrived from Breda, and the emerging talent of 17-year-old Ryan Gauld. Farid El Alagui, who was so prolific with Falkirk, looks like an able replacement for Goodwillie and the on-loan Brentford striker scored in only his second United start. In: Loan: Farid El Alagui, forward (Brentford); Curtis Good, defender (Newcastle United) Out: Ryan Ferguson, midfielder (Brechin City); Ross Smith, defender (Peterhead). Loan ended: David Goodwillie, forward (Blackburn Rovers). Loan: Chris Erskine, midfielder (Partick Thistle); Mark Miller, midfielder (Falkirk); Kudus Oyenuga, forward (Boreham Wood); Ross Gilmour, defender (Airdrieonians); Darren Petrie, midfielder (Brechin City). Joe McGovern, goalkeeper (Clyde) Summer signing report card Pass: Mark Wilson, defender (Bristol City); Paul Paton, midfielder (Partick Thistle); Andrew Robertson, defender (Queen's Park); Nadir Ciftci, forward (Breda); Brian Graham, forward (Raith Rovers) Jury's out: Calum Butcher, defender (Hayes & Yeading); Aidan Connolly, midfielder (Queen's Park) Fail: David Goodwillie, forward (Blackburn Rovers); Chris Erskine, midfielder (Partick Thistle); Kudus Oyenuga, forward (Hayes & Yeading) Key arrivals: Hearts manager Gary Locke has been lamenting the lack of a striker in his squad all season and got his wish when Paul McCallum arrived on loan from West Ham United as part of the one-out, one-in rule governing the signing embargo imposed because they are in administration. However, his arrival is likely to come too late to save the Edinburgh side from relegation. To expect a 20-year-old, no matter how talented, to make up the deficit created by a start-of-season 15-point penalty is too much to ask. Many Hearts fans had seen Rudi Skacel as a potential saviour, but the veteran midfielder struggled to make an impact with Dundee United before being released in the summer and the Scottish Professional Football League rejected the club's request to sign the Czech in any case. In: Loan: Paul McCallum, forward (West Ham United) Out: Adam King, midfielder (Swansea City, undisclosed); Alan Combe, goalkeeper (remains as coach) Summer signing report card Pass: Danny Wilson, defender (Liverpool) Key arrivals: Almost uniquely outside of Celtic, Hibs actually forked out a substantial transfer fee to take James Collins from Swindon Town in the summer. However, the Irishman's failure, along with fellow striking additions Paul Heffernan and the now-departed Rowan Vine, to come anywhere near matching the goal rate of former loanee Leigh Griffiths perhaps more than anything led to Pat Fenlon's departure as manager. New boss Terry Butcher says it will be the summer before he is able to reshape the squad in the way he wants, so for now he is having to hope that Danny Haynes, on loan from Notts County, or Sunderland teenager Duncan Watmore will provide the extra goalscoring spark. Meanwhile, on-loan Arsenal defender Daniel Boateng will be aiming for more game time than he achieved at Swindon Town and Oxford United. In: Loan: Daniel Boateng, defender (Arsenal); Danny Haynes, forward (Notts County); Duncan Watmore, forward (Sunderland) Out: Rowan Vine, forward (Morton); Fraser Mullen, defender (Raith Rovers); Tim Clancy, defender. Loan: Ross Caldwell, forward (Alloa Athletic); David Gold, midfielder (Cowdenbeath) Summer signing report card Pass: Michael Nelson, defender (Bradford City); Ryan McGivern, defender (Manchester City); Liam Craig, midfielder (St Johnstone) Jury's out: Owain Tudur Jones, midfielder (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Paul Heffernan, forward (Kilmarnock); James Collins, forward (Swindon Town, \u00a3200,000); Abdellah Zoubir, midfielder (Istres) Fail: Rowan Vine, forward (St Johnstone); Fraser Mullen, defender (Hearts) Key arrivals: Greg Tansey has already made an impact on his return to Caley Thistle from Stevenage, the midfielder scoring and being a solid influence in the Scottish League Cup semi-final win over Hearts. However, the departure of Terry Butcher summer signings Torbjorn Agdestein and Curtis Allen means new manager John Hughes lacks options up front should top scorer Billy McKay be injured or suspended. In: Greg Tansey, midfielder (Stevenage) Out: Torbjorn Agdestein, forward; Curtis Allen, forward (Glentoran).Loan:Calum Ferguson, forward (Montrose) Summer signing report card Pass: Dean Brill, goalkeeper (Luton Town); James Vincent, midfielder (Kidderminster Harriers); Marley Watkins, midfielder (Hereford United) Jury's out: Nick Draper, goalkeeper (Lincoln City); Carl Tremarco, defender (Macclesfield Town); Joe Gorman, defender (Crewe Alexandra); Ben Greenhalgh, midfielder (Ebbsfleet United); Danny Williams, midfielder (Kendal Town); Adam Evans, midfielder (Burnley) Fail: Torbj\u00f6rn Agdestein, forward (Brighton & Hove Albion); Curtis Allen, forward (Coleraine) Key arrivals: If skilful midfielder Alexei Eremenko makes as good an impression in his second spell at Rugby Park as he did in his first, manager Allan Johnston will be well pleased. However, the Finland international is now 30 and has since had anonymous spells with Russia outfit Rubin Kazan and in Khazakhstan with Kairat Almaty. David Moberg Karlsson is only 19, but the on-loan Sunderland winger has first-team experience with IFK Gothenburg that should help him make an impression in the Scottish Premiership. In: Alexie Eremenko, midfielder (Kairat Almaty). Loan: David Moberg Karlsson, (Sunderland); Vitalijs Maksimenko, defender (Brighton & Hove Albion) Out: Gabriel Reuben, midfielder (Waasland-Beveren); Rabiu Ibrahim, midfielder; Kyle Jacobs, midfielder (Livingston); Mark Stewart, forward (Derry City); Gary Fisher, midfielder (East Fife).Loan: James Fowler, midfielder (Cowdenbeath); Jude Winchester, midfielder (Cliftonville) Summer signing report card Pass: Craig Samson, goalkeeper (St Mirren); Sean Clohessy, defender (Southend United); Barry Nicholson, midfielder (Fleetwood Town); Jackson Irvine, midfielder (Celtic, loan) Jury out: Antonio Reguero, goalkeeper (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Conor Brennan, goalkeeper (Leicester City); Darren Barr, defender (Heart of Midlothian); Ismael Bouzid, defender (Alger); Michael Gardyne, forward (Dundee United) Fail: Caoimhin Bonner, defender (Derry City); Kyle Jacobs, midfielder (Livingston); Mark Stewart, forward (Dundee) Key arrivals: Motherwell manager Stuart McCall had the best success rate of any Scottish Premiership manager during the summer. Which, in addition to a budget made tighter by an early Scottish Cup exit, perhaps explains why he was also the least active in January. His priority was the extension of winger Lionel Ainsworth's loan from Rotherham United and retaining striker Henri Anier, who has now made a permanent switch from Viking Stavanger. Neither Anier, nor fellow summer arrival John Sutton, has managed to match individually the scoring rate of Michael Higdon, who left for Nijmegen. However, as a partnership, with 18 goals between them, they are well on their way to surpassing the total of 31 reached last season by the Englishman and Anier's departed Estonia team-mate, Henrik Ojamaa. In: Loan to permanent: Henri Anier, forward (Viking Stavanger) Out: Loan ended: Dan Twardzik, goalkeeper (Dundee). Loan: Bob McHugh, forward (Queen of the South); Adam Cummins, defender (Dundee) Summer signing report card Pass: Gunnar Nielsen, goalkeeper (Silkeborg); Stephen McManus, defender (Middlesbrough); Iain Vigurs, midfielder (Ross County); John Sutton, forward (Heart of Midlothian); Lionel Ainsworth, midfielder (Rotherham United); Henri Anier, forward (Viking Stavanger) Jury out: Fraser Kerr, defender (Birmingham City); Paul Lawson, midfielder (Ross County); Ben Hall, midfielder (Dungannon Swifts) Key arrivals: The reviews of Partick Thistle on their return to Scotland's top flight have generally read: \"Nice play, shame about the finishing\". So in has come Lyle Taylor, who manager Alan Archibald witnessed terrorising Scottish Championship defences while with Falkirk before heading for Sheffield United. Three goals in his first two games showed promise, but none in his next four suggests the Englishman will need more creative help from a midfield bolstered by three loan signings - Prince Buaben, Chris Erskine and George Moncur - who arrived just before the January deadline. In: Lee Mair, defender (St Mirren). Loan to permanent: Gary Fraser, midfielder (Bolton Wanderers). Loan: Lyle Taylor, forward (Sheffield United); Prince Buaben, midfielder (Carlisle United); George Moncur, midfielder (West Ham United); Chris Erskine, midfielder (Dundee United) Out: John Baird, forward (Raith Rovers); Hugh Murray, midfielder (Dumbarton); Mark McGuigan, forward (Albion Rovers); Mark Kerr, midfielder (Queen of the South); Ross Forbes, midfielder (Dunfermline Athletic). Loan ended: Henoc Mukendi, defender (Liverpool). Loan: Liam Lindsay, defender (Alloa Athletic); James Martin, forward (KV Turnhout); Darren Brownlie, defender (Cowdenbeath) Summer signing report card Pass: Paul Gallacher, goalkeeper (Ross County); Isaac Osbourne, midfielder (Aberdeen); Kallum Higginbotham, forward (Huddersfield Town) Jury out: Gary Fraser, midfielder (Bolton Wanderers); Gabriel, defender (Rayo Vallecano); Darren Brownlie, defender (Ayr United); Simon Colina, midfielder (Barcelona); Declan McDaid, midfielder (Morton); Dale Keenan, midfielder (East Fife) Fail: Mark Kerr, midfielder (Dunfermline Athletic); John Baird, forward (Dundee); Henoc Mukendi, defender (Liverpool) Key arrivals: Ross County manager Derek Adams has been the most active in the January transfer market, adding four players on permanent deals and the same number on loan. His summer signings with previous Scottish top-flight experience having proved more successful than the influx from the Netherlands, Adams in January turned to the English market. On-loan Cardiff City midfielder Filip Kiss has already proved his worth with four goals, even if he blotted his copybook with a red card at the weekend. As has Blackburn Rovers defender Yann Songo'o, who had added two strikes of his own. In: Erik Cikos, defender (Slovan Bratislava); Yoann Arquin, forward (Notts County); Evangelos Ikonomou, defender (Veria); Scott Ferries, midfielder (Aberdeen). Loan: Filip Kiss, midfielder (Cardiff City); Yann Songo'o, defender (Blackburn Rovers); Michael Tidser, midfielder (Rotherham United); Jordan Slew, forward (Blackburn Rovers) Out: Mihael Kovacevic, defender; Branislav Micic, defender. Loan ended: Orhan Mustafi, forward (Grasshoppers). Loan:Steven Ross, midfielder (Brora Rangers) Summer signing report card Pass: Brian McLean, defender (Dundee United); Ben Gordon, defender (Yeovil Town); Graham Carey, midfielder (St Mirren); Melvin de Leeuw, midfielder (Cambuur-Leeuwarden) Jury out: Steven Saunders, defender (Motherwell); Marc Klok, midfielder (Utrecht); Kevin Luckassen, forward (AZ Alkmaar) Fail: Orhan Mustafi, forward (Grasshoppers Zurich); Darren Maatsen, midfielder (Excelsior Rotterdam) Key arrivals: Chris Iwelumo was the most eye-catching of St Johnstone's January additions - not just because of his height but because of his pedigree as a former Scotland striker. After Murray Davidson was ruled out for the rest of the season late in January, manager Tommy Wright swiftly changed his targets to bring in two midfielders - Mark Davies and James Dunne. However, most Saints fans appear to have concerns about a central defence that was not bolstered during the January window. In: Chris Iwelumo, forward (Scunthorpe United); Wayde Joyce, midfielder (Barnsley); Michael O'Halloran, forward (Bolton Wanderers); Fisayo Adarabioyo, midfielder (Birmingham City). Loan: Mark Davies, midfielder (Nottingham Forest); James Dunne, midfielder (Stevenage) Out: Rory Fallon, forward; David Robertson, midfielder (Morton); Sanel Jahic, defender. Loan return: Gwion Edwards, midfielder (Swansea City). Loan: Chris Kane, forward (Dumbarton); Liam Caddis, midfielder (Alloa Athletic); Zander Clark, goalkeeper (Queen of the South) Summer signing report card Pass: Steve Banks, goalkeeper (Dundee United); David Wotherspoon, midfielder (Hibernian); Gary McDonald, midfielder (Morecambe) Jury's out: Brian Easton, defender (Dundee); Lee Croft, midfielder (Oldham Athletic); Mark Hurst, goalkeeper (Livingston); Alex Kitchen, defender (Newcastle United); Scott Brown, midfielder (Bradford City); Scott Stevenson, midfielder (Motherwell); Anthony Higgins, midfielder (Alloa Athletic); Scott-Taylor MacKenzie, midfielder (Livingston); Dwayne Coultress, midfielder (Aldershot); Dylan Easton, forward (Berwick Rangers) Fail: Rory Fallon, forward (Aberdeen); Sanel Jahic, defender (Karabukspor); Gwion Edwards, midfielder (Swansea City) Key arrivals: With most of his summer signings having failed to shine, St Mirren manager Danny Lennon appears to have upped his game for January. Adam Campbell, Josh Magennis and, in particular, Gregg Wylde have already impressed and should increase the Buddies' threat going forward. The experienced Eric Djemba-Djemba should help protect the back four - and they might need it considering the Paisley squad has shed three defenders without replacing them. In: Eric Djemba-Djemba, midfielder (Partizan Belgrade); Gregg Wylde, midfielder (Aberdeen).

{"article": "###\nArticle: But when she walks down through the jagged stairs of the Petare slum in Caracas, she meticulously scans the different supermarkets and pharmacies where she may be able to buy one of the price-controlled products that are so scarce in Venezuela these days. Finding basic products has become a reason for Marta to get out of bed in the morning. \"It's become like an obsession,\" she says. In 2003, then-President Hugo Chavez introduced price controls for some 40 food and hygiene products to guarantee the poor had access to staple goods. But lately, in the midst of a cash crisis, price controls seem to have become a headache. For the first time in years, shortages and inflation have replaced security as the biggest worry for Venezuelans, according to a recent poll by Caracas-based Datanalisis. It is a surprising statistic for one of the most violent countries on earth. But necessity is not the reason why Marta shops - it's opportunity. \"The other day I bought olive oil without knowing what it works for because people were buying it like crazy as it was supposed to be cheap,\" she says. After the global drop in the price of oil, Venezuela's biggest source of revenue, shortages in the South American country went from bad to worse. Datanalisis says every week, on average, Venezuelans go to four different supermarkets and spend around five hours looking for goods. President Nicolas Maduro says shortages are caused by US-backed, far-right groups who smuggle and hoard products in an economic war to destabilise his socialist government. \"Venezuela currently has the necessary goods to feed the people, but there is a problem with distribution,\" says Eduardo Saman, a former commerce minister in the government of the late Hugo Chavez. \"And distribution is in the hands of companies who operate as a cartel and seek to affect the government,\" he tells the BBC. Yet government critics don't believe that this sort of conspiracy is the source of scarcity. \"When you impose prices that are below the value set by supply and demand, you will have an oversubscription and a drop in supply, here or anywhere in the world,\" says Angel Alayon, an economist who has written several papers on scarcity for the ideas website Prodavinci. \"I don't doubt there is hoarding and smuggling, but these are consequences of scarcity, not causes,\" he tells the BBC. Venezuela country profile Partly thanks to price controls, the government has more than halved the malnutrition rates the country recorded 20 years ago, a policy that has been celebrated by international organisations such as the UN. But with the highest inflation rate in the world - 68.5% in December - Mr Alayon says producers can barely cover their costs. The Venezuelan economy shrank throughout last year, hit by falling oil prices. And as the country has fallen into recession, crime has boomed. The government has not made national homicide rates public in more than a year, but independent organisations such as the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence say the rates are increasing. The NGO's annual report for 2014 recorded 24,980 violent deaths - equating to 82 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, up from 79 in 2013. Those are figures for a country at war. Even the police have become victims of crime, as 268 policemen were killed in the country in 2014. A recent poll by the Observatory on Organised Crime reported that 51% of Venezuelans say murders had taken place near where they lived. \"As insecurity is not solved - and far from it, it only gets worse - people had got used to the problem as part of their life without any hope of a real solution nor genuine offers from politicians,\" says Luis Vicente Leon, chief executive of Datanalisis. \"Since people have got used to insecurity, new problems that get worse like shortages or inflation tend to be more mentioned as their main concern.\" But there might also be a psychological reason why shortages have become such an \"obsession\" for Venezuelans. \"Overall, at the precise moment when you stop finding a product, it becomes more precious than it used to be,\" says American psychologist Eldar Shafir, co-author of Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much. \"Think of it as a work of art that was stolen and when it is found the price is three times higher. \"When you're not able to get something, it becomes a challenge that captures your attention, to the point of getting obsessed with it and sacrificing other things that are on the periphery, such as exercising or playing with your children.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Marta doesn't need to go shopping today, because her fridge is filled with all the products her family requires.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device A beautifully controlled half-volley from Jonny Hayes after nine minutes was reward for a fine Dons start. But Celtic were level within two minutes as Stuart Armstrong was given too much time to pick out the far corner from the edge of the box. Late Celtic pressure paid off as Rogic fired low past goalkeeper Joe Lewis. A thrilling 90 minutes concluded with Celtic not only lifting the cup for the first time since 2013 but becoming the first side in Scotland to complete an unbeaten treble. It is the 37th time the Hoops have lifted the world's oldest national football trophy and the fourth time they have won the treble - and their first since 2001. Derek McInnes' Dons, looking to end a 27-year wait to win the competition for an eighth time, were left as runners-up to Brendan Rodgers' side in the Premiership, the League Cup and now the Scottish Cup. It was a pulsating cup final right from the start, Aberdeen coming out with an edge to their play that put their illustrious rivals on the back foot. Yes, Rodgers' team had won five out of five in the head-to-heads this season, with an aggregate score of 12-2, but this was an altogether different Dons to previous versions. In this classic, they were a team reborn. In the beginning, they harried Celtic's go-to men. Graeme Shinnie and Kenny McLean were commanding. They lived in their faces defensively and showed plenty offensively. The feeling was that Aberdeen had to take the lead to make a true fight of this final and that is precisely what they did. Having shipped three early goals to Celtic in their last meeting, the Dons changed the narrative. From a Niall McGinn corner, Hayes came round the blindside of Leigh Griffiths and smashed a volley past goalkeeper Craig Gordon and beyond Kieran Tierney on the line. It was a goal of quality and a goal that electrified the huge Aberdeen support. Celtic are champions, though, and their true selves emerged only two minutes later when Aberdeen unwisely stood off Armstrong, who thumped in the equaliser low to Lewis's left. Two early goals and the intensity only cranked up from there. Midway through the half, there was controversy. Jayden Stockley - selected up front ahead of Adam Rooney - swung an arm into Tierney's face and the young Celtic full-back immediately signalled that he was in bother. Blood poured from his mouth and, after treatment, he had to leave the field. Stockley has a reputation for over-zealous use of his arms and elbows and was deeply fortunate not to see red for a fourth time this season. He claimed it was accidental, but Celtic were having none of it. They were incensed. Callum McGregor shifted to left-back and Rogic came into the final and things went up another level. Gordon made a double save in quick order and then made another from a Stockley header. Celtic were rattled, they were totally unable to get a hold of the game in the face of the Dons' aggressive edge. It was Celtic, however, who should have gone ahead just before the break when a delicious Griffiths delivery was put over from point-blank range by Scott Sinclair. The toe-to-toe nature of the contest carried on brilliantly. Griffiths and Sinclair went close then Aberdeen swept downfield on a breakaway and a priceless chance was wasted. Hayes had mugged McGregor down the right and, with McLean running free in the box, all they had to do was get their communication right and a goal was certain. They didn't. Hayes hit his pass slightly behind McLean and the midfielder couldn't hook it in. Agony for Aberdeen. Celtic then moved up a gear and now it was the Dons pinned on the ropes. Lewis pushed a Patrick Roberts shot on to his post. From the resulting corner, Celtic's Mikael Lustig tugged the ball just wide. The game opened up as wide as the Clyde. Aberdeen's Ash Taylor headed away from under his own crossbar, Dedryck Boyota headed just over, Gordon made a fine save from Shinnie and then it was Lewis's turn again, saving wonderfully from Griffiths. Lewis was immense for the Dons. As the final wore on, Celtic took an ever-tightening grip. Rodgers' side pressed and pressed and a tiring Aberdeen threw their bodies in front of shots to keep alive. Their scrambling defence was constant and heroic. But it wasn't enough. With all at Hampden steeling themselves for extra-time, Rogic ran at Aberdeen down the right, going past the utterly jaded Andrew Considine and slamming his shot low under Lewis. Extraordinary. The heartbroken Dons had made it a mighty battle, but Celtic showed their incomparable will and their domestic greatness. The history makers had done it again. A treble won. Truly, they are something special. Match ends, Celtic 2, Aberdeen 1. Second Half ends, Celtic 2, Aberdeen 1. (Celtic) wins a free kick in the defensive half. Foul by Adam Rooney (Aberdeen).

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is accused of masterminding the attacks while the others are implicated for providing support for the co-ordinated hijacking. In May, a chaotic hearing in the case lasted 13 hours. During that hearing, which formally charged the five men, the defendants made defiant outbursts and refused to answer the judge's questions or use the translation system. In addition to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, defendants Ramzi Binalshibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Waleed bin Attash are being prosecuted in a special military tribunal for wartime offences known as a military commission. They are charged with conspiring with al-Qaeda, terrorism, and one count of murder for each known victim of the 11 September attacks at the time the charges were filed - 2,976 in total. The five face a possible death penalty sentence if convicted. CIA waterboarding tapes revealed On Monday, the defendants listened calmly and answered the judge's questions, although Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said: \"I don't think there's any justice in this court.\" Defence lawyers argued during the hearing that their clients should not be forced to attend the rest of the week's hearings, because the forcible transport from their high-security cells may remind them of their time at secret CIA prisons. Before their transfer to the US base at Guantanamo Bay in 2006, the defendants were held for years in secret CIA prisons. All five have said they were tortured during interrogations. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was repeatedly water-boarded before being brought to Guantanamo. \"We have to talk about torture,\" Air Force Captain Michael Schwartz, a defence lawyer, said on Monday. But Judge James Pohl said the issue was not relevant at this stage. Prosecution lawyers have said the use of waterboarding and similar methods could be relevant when determining whether prisoners' statements were voluntarily given. The court is also expected to hear a defence request to abolish what they term a \"presumptive classification\" that treats any discussion of the CIA prisons as top secret, as well as a media request to limit closing of the courtroom for secret sessions. Judge Pohl ultimately ruled that the defendants would not be forced to attend hearings scheduled to run through the end of this week, but did not rule out further pre-trial hearings. He said all would have to be present for their trial, which is not likely to start for more than a year.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others accused over the 9/11 attacks have appeared at a US military tribunal for the first time in five months.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Beyonce now has 62 Grammy nominations across her work as a solo artist and as part of Destiny's Child, making her the fourth most-nominated artist ever. She has won 20 trophies altogether, although she has yet to clinch the album of the year prize, having been beaten to the title by Beck in 2015 - much to the disgust of Kanye West, who stormed the stage in protest. West receives eight nominations this year for his album The Life Of Pablo - all in the rap categories. Drake and Rihanna also have eight nominations, including three for their hit collaboration, Work. Making Grammy history is Chicago-born musician Chance The Rapper, whose album Coloring Book is the first streaming-only record to be recognised by the Recording Academy. He achieves seven nominations, including best new artist, without ever releasing a physical album or digital download. Beyonce and Adele go head to head with Justin Bieber, Drake and country star Sturgill Simpson in the best album category. If Adele wins, she will become only the second woman to receive the best album prize twice, after Taylor Swift. Notably absent from the shortlist is David Bowie, who was tipped to win for his critically-acclaimed Blackstar album. The record does make an appearance in the best alternative album category, as does Radiohead's A Moon Shaped Pool. Coldplay have also fared badly, receiving just one nomination - best music video - despite selling millions of copies of their latest album, A Head Full Of Dreams.

It also wants to build a manufacturing plant in Scotland, creating up to 500 direct jobs and 1,000 supply-side jobs. Renfrew-based Steel Engineering aims to double its 120 staff by opening a new plant and building a mini-port for ships on the River Clyde. By Douglas FraserBBC Scotland Business and Economy Editor It's taken a lot of huffing and puffing, but at last the economic wind turbine is turning. And it looks good for Clydeside that it has attracted four large multi-national firms to locate key bases there. Mitsubishi and Scottish & Southern Energy have a joint centre for engineering excellence in Glasgow, Iberdrola has opted to put its international renewables planning centre near its ScottishPower subsidiary. Also from Spain, Gamesa has opted for Glasgow as a research base, while looking at Dundee for manufacturing and logistic support. The biggest commitment so far is from Doosan Power Systems, a subsidiary of the vast Doosan conglomerate based in South Korea. It is new into the wind turbine business, though it's not new to green energy research, as a partner with Scottish & Southern Energy on early stages of commercialising carbon capture and storage. The research and development centre comes first, with 500 jobs to follow in a turbine manufacturing plant. So far Scotland's only had one such plant, near Campbeltown, and it's had a troubled couple of years, with three owners. So Doosan's statement of intent is a sign that the green jobs potential and hopes may be moving towards reality. The jobs announcements were made by both companies, who were visited by First Minister Alex Salmond. Doosan intends to locate its research and development centre for renewables at its current site at Westway in Renfrew, creating up to 200 jobs. The Korean firm is also in talks with the business development agency, Scottish Enterprise, to set up manufacturing and assembly facilities in Scotland - its favoured location for wind turbine development and production. Doosan expects its offshore wind plans in Scotland to create up to 1,700 new jobs. The firm aims to directly recruit about 700 new staff, with a further 1,000 employed in associated supply companies. In a separate announcement, Steel Engineering, which is also based at Westway in Renfrew, said it aimed to create 120 jobs by expanding its business servicing a range of clean energy sectors, including offshore wind, wave and tidal power. The firm is getting a \u00c2\u00a31.8m government grant towards the \u00c2\u00a33m investment. Steel Engineering is also in talks with Skills Development Scotland about developing a training school with Anniesland College in Glasgow. This would aim to provide training tailored to the latest fabrication techniques, and welding procedures required by the renewables industry. Mr Salmond said both announcements were \"great news for Renfrew and for the wider Scottish economy\". He described the Doosan initiatives as \"another great stride forward for the renewables industry in Scotland - which is now the chosen destination for three energy engineering giants to design their next generation of turbines to service the global offshore wind industry\". The first minister added: \"Scotland also plays a key role in the energy industry supply chain and Steel Engineering are an excellent example of how Scottish companies with great experience servicing the offshore oil and gas industry have been building the renewables side of their business.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Expansion plans by two engineering firms could create 820 new jobs in Scotland's renewable energy sector.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

But saving birds by re-homing them after they have finished their commercial lives is what keeps Wales international Allen busy. \"The football can threaten to take over at times but spending time with my family and pets is very important to me so I always find a way to get the right balance,\" he told the British Hen Welfare Trust publication.

He credits drumming with improving his keeping skills too, recently telling the Arsenal Weekly podcast: \"It is especially useful for a goalkeeper. There are so many things I learn on the drums that I can use in goalkeeping as well, because the hand-eye coordination and the independence on each of the limbs is helpful.\" Cech showed off his musical skills in a Christmas video for the Arsenal foundation, alongside team-mates Alexis Sanchez and Nacho Monreal. Media playback is not supported on this device The former Liverpool defender is now playing back home in Denmark, at Brondby. The prototype inked footballer was one of the first to sport tattoo sleeves but is also capable of etching his designs onto others - he's a qualified tattoo artist. The Russian ex-Arsenal forward is still playing for Kairat at the age of 34, but when his career ends he can still fall back on the fashion design skills he learned at university, where his thesis was on tracksuit design. Turns out he's pretty handy with a needle and thread, too. Tottenham and Manchester United fans used to say he was an artist when he played in the Premier League. Now playing for PAOK in Greece, the Bulgarian striker is as deft with a pencil in his hand as he is with the ball at his feet. He has posted sketches of rapper Snoop Dogg, actor Marlon Brando and the Breaking Bad cast to his social media accounts. The Everton full-back, 35, has not made a first-team appearance this season, which will have given him more time to focus on his carp fishing empire.

In the UK, an act of Parliament passed in 1928 allowed for Easter Sunday to be fixed on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April. However, this has never been activated and Easter has remained variable, determined by the moon's cycle. Easter is the most important Christian festival, as it celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ following his death by crucifixion on Good Friday. The archbishop said he was in talks with Pope Francis, Coptic leader Pope Tawadros, and the leader of the Orthodox church Patriarch Bartholomew. Mr Welby said he hoped the change would happen \"in between five and 10 years time\". \"I would love to see it before I retired\", he said, although he warned the first attempt to make such a change was in the 10th Century. An Anglican source told the BBC there had been 15 attempts to agree a common date since then. Easter is on the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon following the spring equinox, meaning it can be celebrated on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April. But the Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, hence has later Easter celebrations compared with those of Western Christianity. In 1990, the Vatican approved a proposal for a fixed date, which was subject to agreement with other Christian churches and governments.

A defence ministry statement said the strikes had inflicted \"significant damage\" and that a large number of militants had been killed. Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), whose activists have reported on developments on the ground in Raqqa since IS militants seized control of the city in early 2014, said the water pumping station hit in Thursday's strikes was located in the nearby village of Kasrat.

RBSS said 20 civilians had been killed and 50 others wounded in the air strikes, but the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll higher. It said 24 civilians had died, along with six others whose identities could not yet be confirmed.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Now, as Jaguar Land Rover announces plans to create an extra 1,700 jobs at its base in Solihull - on top of 800 created in January - is the West Midlands town becoming \"Land Rover Land\"? Discovery, Defender, and Freelander models line the leafy cul-de-sacs that surround the plant on the outskirts of the town centre. Families talk about the difficulty of finding their cars in supermarket car parks because there are now so many of the same cars from the same company. Even Solihull Council is in on the act, with the mayoral car being - of course - a black 2013 Range Rover Vogue. \"Suddenly they are everywhere, throughout the streets of Solihull,\" said mayor Joe Tildesley. \"I look out the window and it's the first car I see. It's a status vehicle people aspire to have. \"They are here and are - quite properly - endorsed by many people, including the council. I don't see it as a bad thing.\" Mother-of-three Julie Henn, lives in Nerstal Drive in Solihull, just a stone's throw away from the Jaguar Land Rover site. The 55-year-old said she regretted leaving her Land Rover behind so much when she moved to the UK from South Africa about eight years ago that she ended up buying a replacement soon afterwards. Her husband is now hoping to buy a new one as well. \"There was not a day that went by when I did not regret it,\" she said. \"Now I can't believe how many there are. On Saturday I saw four in a row. \"A Range Rover, two Discoveries and a Freelander - one after the other.\" Mrs Henn said she knew people who struggled to find their Land Rovers in supermarket car parks because they were so common. Mother-of two Joanne Rumney, who lives around the corner in Oakslade Drive, owns a Land Rover Discovery from the 1990s. \"People are proud to have JLR here,\" said the 38-year-old. \"It has a status that people like. They are good family cars.\" Jaguar Land Rover, which also has manufacturing bases in Castle Bromwich and Halewood on Merseyside, has said the latest announcement will bring the total number of jobs it has created in the UK over the past three years to almost 11,000. Mr Tildesley said the firm's investment had \"undoubtedly\" boosted Solihull with other firms benefiting from knock-on trade. Rachael Eade, from the Manufacturing Advisory Service, said every job created by vehicle manufacturers leads to two or three in the supply chain. \"It's a huge confidence booster locally and UK-wide,\" she said. \"It's 1,700 jobs and three times that in the supply chain. \"I think the new technology involved will attract a new, younger market and will make a difference to the supply chain. \"Younger people have more of a desire to be involved in that as they probably view car manufacturing to be a bit dusty, dirty and not for them.\" But not everyone is happy. Some shops said the expansion had brought with it increased parking problems. Terry Cosma, manager of Solihull Fish Bar in Hob's Moat Road, said: \"I have not noticed any change in business. We have always had a steady flow of JLR workers. \"The big problem is the lack of parking round here. They are along the pavements, the grass verges, sometimes it's difficult to get into the side roads.\" Julie Jones, who works at Trev's Hairdressers, also in Hob's Moat Road, said: \"The parking is ridiculous - diabolical. \"There is nowhere for us to go because all the Land Rover workers are there.\" In 2005, MG Rover based at Longbridge, less than 10 miles from Solihull, went into administration. About 14,000 people employed by the Rover group were based at the site. But Ms Eade said she did not believe Solihull would suffer a similar fate and collapse if JLR's fortunes changed in the future. \"The automotive industry has learnt lessons from MG Rover,\" she said. \"They are not as heavily reliant on one customer now and if you are a designer you probably work for JLR, Mini, JCB, Ford. \"I don't think the bubble will burst for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Swindon is known by some as \"Honda Town\" and Detroit as \"Motor City\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said it would not block a lower-court ruling that halted the order. Mr Trump responded with an angry tweet saying national security was at risk and there would be a legal challenge. But the 3-0 unanimous ruling said the government had not proved the terror threat justified reviving the ban. The ruling means that people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen with visas can continue to enter the US. And refugees from around the world, who were also subject to a temporary ban, are no longer blocked either. The case is now likely to end up at the highest court, the US Supreme Court. They rejected the argument, made by the Justice Department on behalf of the US government, that the president had sole discretion to set immigration policy. The court also said there was \"no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order\" had committed a terror attack in the US. They said both sides had made compelling cases. \"On the one hand, the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies. \"And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination.\" But they said the law stripped foreign arrivals of their rights under the Constitution. Mr Trump responded to the ruling by tweeting his dissent, and then gave an audio statement saying it was a political decision. The Justice Department, which made representations to the appeals court on behalf of the White House, said in a statement it was \"reviewing the decision and considering its options\". Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had sued over the ban, said it was a complete victory for the state. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said: \"Here in New York - the safest big city in America - we will always protect our neighbours, no matter where they came from or when they got here. Those are our values.\" Donald Trump's lawyers did not make their case. In fact, according to three Ninth Circuit judges, they didn't even really try to make their case. Rather than explaining why the temporary travel ban was needed, the administration argued that the president's authority on immigration was so sweeping that they didn't have to explain why the order was necessary. According to the court, the government was unable to say why Mr Trump's ban addressed a pressing national security threat that a temporary stay of the order would worsen. The lawyers for the challenging states, on the other hand, convinced the judges that re-imposing the order at this point would create further chaos by infringing on the due process rights of those on US soil, regardless of their immigration status. By issuing a unanimous, unsigned opinion, the judges avoid accusations of partisan bias, as one of the three was a Republican appointee. Mr Trump tweeted a sharp \"SEE YOU IN COURT\" following the decision - but which court? An appeal to the Supreme Court seems likely, although a better move for the president may be to fight in the lower court until Judge Neil Gorsuch joins a conservative majority on the bench. The executive order, at the end of Mr Trump's first week in office, had sparked protests and confusion as people were stopped at US borders. Then a week later, a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order that stopped the ban in its tracks, after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit in San Francisco, which heard oral arguments this week. Lawyers representing the US government argued that the ban was a \"lawful exercise\" of presidential authority. But the two US states said the ban had harmed universities in their states and discriminated against Muslims. The appeal judges did not rule on the constitutionality or the merits of the law, just on the question of its reinstatement. The lower court in Seattle must still debate its merits and there are other legal challenges across the country.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A US appeals court has rejected President Donald Trump's attempt to reinstate his ban on visitors from seven mainly Muslim countries.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: A stake in a local energy business could cost from just \u00c2\u00a35, and the industry says it could generate an annual return of between 6% and 9%. The scheme aims to reduce local opposition to renewable energy development. It has been developed by the renewable industry alongside community groups. The Shared Ownership Taskforce plan follows similar programmes in Denmark which have been running for more than two decades. It applies to anything entering the planning system from Monday. More than 70% of people in the UK nationally say they like wind farms, according to a government survey. However, proximity often provokes a different response and the wind farms are frequently considered a blot on the landscape. The government previously insisted that wind farm developers should give local communities \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year for every megawatt of energy installed - to support local initiatives. The taskforce goes further by insisting that any new applications entering the planning system must offer to sell part of their business to locals - somewhere between 5 and 25%. This can be in the form of directly-owned shares, crowd-funding or debentures. Nina Skorupska, Chief Executive, Renewable Energy Association welcomes the plan. She told BBC News:  \"Elsewhere in Europe this is commonplace, so we're very pleased the UK is also working towards this vision of a more open energy market.\" The scheme has been promoted by the Energy and Climate Change Secretary, Edward Davey. He said: \"Community energy is revolutionising renewable energy development in the UK, and shared ownership will offer people the opportunity to buy in to the green energy that their own communities are producing.\" The Vice-Chair of the Taskforce and an associate of Co-operatives UK, Rebecca Willis, said: \"We know from our experience at grass roots level that there's a substantial appetite among local communities to invest in renewable energy.\" There are, though, still likely to be areas where local people will prefer to keep their uninterrupted view than to cash in a regular dividend cheque.

Crantock Parish Council told the duchy in April it was \"extremely concerned about the safety risks to the public\". The duchy said new warning signs were put up in 2016 and it planned to \"see what more can possibly be done\". More on this story, and other Devon and Cornwall news The duchy was involved in a series of meetings and concluded there was no \"simple solution\" as the area had protected status, and that re-engineering the course of a river was a complicated and long process with no guarantees of success. The council said the beach had become more dangerous since a breakwater was damaged by storms in 2015, causing the River Gannel to change course. Earlier this month 11 bodyboarders had to be rescued at the same beach. The council said: \"Since the river diverted, very significant movements of sand have occurred that have made bathing conditions extremely dangerous at certain states of tide and sea condition\". The council met the duchy, the National Trust and the Marine Management Organisation on 27 January to discuss the issue but no repairs were authorised.

{"article": "###\nArticle: But what really strikes you, especially in those initial developmental stages, is how familiar the forms look. How like an early human foetus, they appear. \"This is something you see time and time again in vertebrates, not just with mammals,\" says Richard Sabin, the Natural History Museum's top whale expert. \"You see these similarities in the early developmental stages and it's really not until you're halfway through the gestation - which  for a humpback whale is around 11 months - that you start to see the things that make that foetus characteristically the species that it is.\" Richard has a remarkable sequence of seven humpback foetuses that he's going to put on display for the NHM's major summer exhibition on cetaceans. They go from what is essentially just a ball of cells that's perhaps only a few weeks old, all the way through to a specimen that appears to be a perfect humpback in miniature. This larger foetus, about half a metre in length, is probably seven to eight months into the gestation period. It has everything you would expect to see in a humpback, including those long, tell-tale pectoral flippers with their nobbly tubercles. The specimens were collected at the beginning of the 20th Century by scientists who had been sent to the Antarctic to gather data on the activities of the whaling fleets. Their role was to understand the biology, the movements, and the ecology of whales - to appreciate the status of stocks so that the commercial returns could be maximised. It's an awkward feeling knowing that these foetuses were taken from harpooned pregnant humpbacks. Somehow you have to console yourself with the recognition that the acquired data was ultimately what shut down that bloody industry. \"There is a story with every specimen and it may not be a very comfortable story, but it is something we have to acknowledge,\" says Richard. \"The thing to remember is that the data we get from these specimens we actively use for marine conservation purposes now.\" Just this past week, a Swiss-led team used old whaling data to show how species had shrunk in size in the 40 years prior to the stocks collapsing. This trend signal, the team said, could be used to warn of imminent disaster in other hunted wildlife groups. What have we learned from foetuses, specifically? A lot it seems about evolutionary biology. \"One thing we see in these humpbacks is the development of tooth buds at around four-to-five months into gestation. They're then reabsorbed to allow the baleen to start to develop,\" explains Richard. The baleen are the keratin plates that hang from the upper-jaw and filter the humpbacks' prey. \"So, we know from the study of these foetuses, from an evolutionary developmental perspective, that there was a time when all cetaceans were toothed and that baleen are a relatively recent development. And we've only just found the fossils that back that up.\" The whales exhibition is due to open on 14 July, the day after the NHM re-opens its front entrance. The Hintze Hall has been remodelled. Its emblematic diplodocus (\"Dippy\") dinosaur is being replaced by a blue whale skeleton that will hang from the ceiling (Plot spoiler: I've had a sneak peek already and it looks spectacular). So, it's certainly a timely moment to highlight the contribution of cetaceans to life on Earth. More than 100 specimens from the London museum's collections are being set up in the institution's Waterhouse Gallery. The exhibition will impress upon visitors the huge diversity of whales, dolphins and porpoises. It will explain their relatively short evolutionary journey, from being land animals 50 million years ago to becoming the well-adapted ocean-dwellers we know today. And it will describe how they move, how they breathe, and how some echolocate to find their prey. It still astounds me that whales can communicate over many hundreds of kilometres. \"We want people to realise that as well as being mammals like us, they also have complex culture like us,\" says Richard. \"This is a very new area of study that has accelerated in just the past 10 years through observations, through genetic information and the data coming from museum specimens.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "It's a curious thing to see a group of early whale foetuses up close - to see beings so small that have the potential to become so big.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave rates at their new, historically low, level was no surprise. Last month the Bank halved its bank rate from 0.5% as it tried to ensure the stability of the UK's banking system in the aftermath of the June Brexit referendum vote. That was the first rate cut since 2009. But the Bank said again that it might cut rates further in the coming months, even though the immediate economic after-shock of the Brexit vote now appears to be weaker than first thought. \"A number of indicators of near-term economic activity have been somewhat stronger than expected,\" the Bank said in the minutes of its latest MPC meeting. It added that if its economic forecasts in November were similar to those it had formulated in August, then \"a majority of members expected to support a further cut in bank rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC's forthcoming meetings during the course of the year.\" The Bank noted that a variety of economic indicators have suggested that the UK economy has shrugged off the post-referendum surprise in the short-term. As a result, the Bank is not as gloomy about the short-term state of the economy as it was a month ago. But it said that it still expects the pace of economic activity in the July-September period to have halved from the growth rate recorded earlier in the year. The Bank's internal judgement is that growth in Q3 (that's July to September) will now be between 0.2% and 0.3%, a pretty chunky upgrade on its August forecast of 0.1%. It's not an official forecast, but given the Q3 growth figure will be announced before the next meeting of the MPC in November, it is as close as we are going to get. Looking at 2017, the MPC says it is harder to make a judgement, but if the present economic momentum continues, then expect an upgrade in growth forecasts for next year and 2018 after brutal downgrades last month. It still says that is considering cutting interest rates again - to 0.1% - but the chances of that must be lower given the better economic news. Read Kamal's full analysis here Under a new timetable which replaces the long-standing practice of monthly meetings, the next MPC meeting will take place in November. It is at that point that some City economists expect a further cut in bank rate to just 0.1%. The latest vote of MPC members, who include the governor Mark Carney, was unanimous - at 9-0. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: \"The Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates on hold was unsurprising. \"Although the post-referendum economic data has been decidedly mixed, we expect growth to slow sharply in 2017. \"We anticipate the MPC will move again to cut interest rates before the end of the year,\" he added. The MPC also voted to stick with the expansion of its quantitative easing (QE) policy, which it announced in August. That means the bank will now buy an extra \u00a360bn of government bonds - taking the total to \u00a3435bn - along with a further \u00a310bn of corporate bonds, as part of its continuing attempts to keep the economy from sliding into recession.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The Bank of England has left its main interest rate at 0.25% but says another cut is still a possibility.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: In recent months, state media have been stressing the waters have been China's \"since ancient times\". Now, state media are rolling out masses of fresh material aimed at discrediting The Hague tribunal's ruling. State media anticipated the Permanent Court of Arbitration's findings. Almost immediately, outlets including Xinhua news agency released a prepared statement describing the decision as \"illegal and invalid\". \"China has repeatedly declared that the arbitration tribunal does not have jurisdiction; China neither accepts nor recognises it,\" Xinhua said. It then released a government statement saying China \"has territorial sovereignty and maritime rights over the South China Sea islands\" and \"resolutely opposes a few countries' illegal violations\" - a reference to the US and its allies in the region. But it hinted at a way forward, saying there is potential for China to enter into \"joint developments\" in order to \"achieve win-win results\" and peace and stability in the South China Sea. State-run CCTV cited the foreign ministry's view that the tribunal proceedings were \"null and void\". It featured British, Iranian, Pakistani and Lebanese experts who questioned the verdict. Oxford academic Antonios Tzanakopoulos told the TV that he did not find the tribunal's points \"fully convincing\". CCTV also hinted at possible negotiations with the Philippines. It showed former Filipino ambassador Alberto Encomienda saying American interference had triggered the case. He added: \"There's a lot we can do, not in terms of what China can do for us, but what we can do together for the region.\" There was an immediate attempt to control online discussion in China. In the minutes before the announcement, Sina Weibo's hashtag #SouthChinaSeaArbitration was number one in its top 10. Its landing page carried more than 170,000 posts. Once the result was out, the hashtag disappeared from Sina's ranking. State media and its millions of followers - including Xinhua, People's Daily and CCTV - adopted a similarly-named hashtag, #SouthChinaSeaArbitrationCase. It quickly rose to number one in the ranking, with posts overwhelmingly dismissing the Hague ruling. Meanwhile, over at censorship-monitoring website Free Weibo, \"South China Sea\" became the most-censored term. The press room was packed but the statement from Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay lasted just two minutes. In four short paragraphs, he explained that experts were now analysing the ruling and called on all concerned to exercise \"constraint and sobriety\" at what he described as a \"milestone decision\". There were no celebrations, hardly even a smile. And there's a reason for that. This is not the same government that first brought this case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration three and a half years ago, in the aftermath of a standoff at Scarborough Shoal. Two weeks ago, Rodrigo Duterte was sworn in as Philippine president. All the indications are that he is more willing to seek accommodation with the Chinese than his predecessor, Benigno Aquino. Here in Manila, many believe that the new president may have sought promises of Chinese investment, in return for a quiet, dignified response.

Floodwater is also threatening parts of Austria and the Czech Republic. At least 13 people have died and two are missing as a result of the floods. Rising waters have been triggered by heavy rain following a wet spring. Eight deaths were recorded in the Czech Republic and three in Germany, while two people were reported dead and two missing in Austria, according to a European Commission update on Tuesday evening. Parts of Germany have not seen such severe flooding in centuries. However, in the Czech Republic, the water level has stabilised in the capital Prague, where there had been fears of a repeat of disasters in 2002 and 1997. Helicopters started removing residents from their homes in Deggendorf on Wednesday after two levees along the Danube and Isar rivers broke. Firefighter Alois Schraufstetter said the floodwater in the Bavarian town was 3m (9.8ft) high. \"This is a life-threatening situation,\" he was quoted as saying by Germany's DPA news agency. Four farmers were rescued at the very last minute by a helicopter before their tractor was submerged, he added. German newspapers said water levels in the eastern city of Halle were at their highest for four centuries. Officials said the city was in acute danger after floodwaters from the Saale river damaged a section of dykes. The level of the River Elbe in the historic German city of Dresden, where at least 600 people were evacuated, is not expected to peak until Thursday morning. Coaches reportedly ferried people out the town of Muhlberg, about 40km (25 miles) northwest of Dresden, as thousands were told to leave on Wednesday afternoon. Chemical plants next to the swollen rivers have been shut down and their chemicals removed over safety concerns, the Associated Press reports.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Cricket and Nigeria may seem an incongruous pairing, but in Lagos many a weekend players in their colourful kit take to the crease on a dusty pitch in a fiercely competitive cricket league. \"This league actually boasts about 99% of the Nigerian national team,\" says Femi Solebo, who chairs the Club Cricket Committee Lagos and also plays for the Ibeju Lekki Cricket Club. Watching a game from the welcome shade of the pavilion, he occasionally shouts out instructions to his batsmen taking on Government College Ibadan in a 50-over game. \"Over the last three or four years Nigerian cricket has stepped up quite a lot and has allowed these guys here to show their stuff at an international level,\" he says. \"Recently the national team got promoted to division five in the World Cricket League, which is a huge achievement for us - we've never been there before in the history of Nigerian cricket.\" Mr Solebo, who first started playing cricket whilst at school in the UK, reckons that in a population of more than 170 million \"there must be a million or so followers of cricket in Nigeria quite easily\". However, not many of them are at Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval next to Lagos' dilapidated old racecourse. Besides a few team members on the stand and a man barbecuing meat, only a small group watches from deckchairs under a nearby tree, keeping refreshed with drinks from a cool box. Some of them turn out to be former Nigerian internationals - stalwarts of the game, some of whom are updating a chat group of enthusiasts with the latest scores by mobile phone. Femi Solebo, Club Cricket Committee Lagos chair: I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me \"In our time we didn't have as much exposure as the current national team does, we were restricted in playing in just the West African region,\" says Barnaby Ephraim, who now helps administer the game in Lagos. He says it is the Lagos league, which was started more than 15 years ago, that has helped raise the profile of cricket and the opportunity to play it outside school and university. It is also tempering attitudes that see the game as elitist and old fashioned, with some schools - even the established private ones - not seeing the sport as a priority. And Mr Solebo admits it is difficult to rival football as there are not the fans to warrant tickets that would pay for the upkeep of a turf pitch. The ground the teams use is often rented out by the cash-strapped Nigerian Cricket Federation - and with upcoming elections, political rallies have recently been held here, playing havoc with the pitch, already like concrete after the dry Harmattan season. The game is also expensive for players given the kit needed. \"With soccer, all you need is just one ball and then you're away,\" says the 45-year-old. But he says whilst the league is sponsored by private individuals like him with a passion for the game, most of the 400 players in its two divisions are \"from the streets\". The Ibeju Lekki club helps pay for either a player's education or vocational training - and subsidises kit and lunches. Kunle Adegbola, Nigerian cricket captain: Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football \"Whatever it is they want to do, we'll fund that and insist that you can only be a member of this club if you have some kind of educational background - and that's what the other clubs try to do as well,\" says Mr Solebo, who runs a company that generates electricity. \"I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me. \"Some of them are doing very well in university, some of them have left and are working now.\" A few of Lagos' cricketers have even gone professional, like Nigerian cricket captain Kunle Adegbola. The towering 33-year-old has come to practise for his Foundation Cricket Club in the nets ahead of a game the next day. When the season ends in April in Lagos he will head off to London, where he has played for Burgess Park and Blackheath cricket clubs in the past. He says with more awareness, spectators and sponsorship, he sees great things for Nigerian cricket. \"Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria...  in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football,\" he says. But the Lagosian cricketers know gaining such momentum will only be achieved with serious corporate sponsorship - which would be more likely if ongoing negotiations with a cable TV company bear fruit. So far TV executives have been reluctant to go ahead as they would prefer a national league. \"But we say that we can take it in phases, adopt Lagos first and then you can open up,\" says Mr Ephraim, vice-chair of the Lagos State Cricket Association which is also trying to rejuvenate youth interest in cricket. He says that unlike other states there are 35 schools in Lagos now playing cricket - with both boys and girls participating. Ibeju Lekki player Endurance Ofem agrees junior involvement is key to putting cricket on a football footing. But the former captain of the Nigerian side says offering national team players good welfare packages like those available to professional footballers is important too. \"If you do that, every youngster sees the reason to come and play cricket.\" For Mr Solebo, competing with football is not the issue - it is the cricket that matters. \"It makes me very proud that our efforts give people joy every weekend - they come here, play with passion and it's fantastic.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Nigeria has produced its fair share of great sportsmen and women - but unlike footballers and polo players, cricketers rarely get the West African nation's heart beating.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Now a group of walkers is re-tracing his steps. They set off from Shrewsbury Abbey on 18 June, ending up at St Winefride's Well a week later. The walk is part of a week of events to commemorate the historic royal visit and which, it is hoped, will boost the profile of the town. \"Holywell has an incredible, unique history,\" said Rob Owen, one of the organisers of the town's upcoming medieval festival. \"Castles are ten a penny in Wales,  but there's only one St Winefride's Well.\" Mrs Owen is rightly proud of her town's famous landmark - St Winefride's Well has been a place of pilgrimage for more than 1,300 years and is the oldest continually venerated shrine of any British saint. According to legend, Winefride was the daughter of a 7th Century nobleman, who shunned the amorous advances of a local prince named Caradog. Furious at her rejection, Caradog beheaded her as she ran towards the safety of her uncle's church. Her severed head rolled down the hill and a powerful spring burst up from the earth at the place it came to rest. But all was not lost for Winefride - her uncle, St Beuno, placed her head back on her body and prayed and miraculously, she was restored to life. Caradog, meanwhile, met a sticky end:  cursed by St Beuno, his body melted and was swallowed up by the earth. Winefride became a nun and later, Abbess of Gwytherin in Conwy, where she died and was buried. The healing waters of her well are said to bring forth miraculous cures; believers still bathe there today and Holywell has become known as the \"Lourdes of Wales\". In 1138, Prior Robert of Shrewsbury moved the saint's remains to his abbey, later writing a \"Life\" - or biography - of Winefride, which was to prove instrumental in spreading her popularity. In medieval times, she became the saintly equivalent of a superstar. \"Winefride, or Gwenfrewy as she is known in Welsh, is the only native female saint from Wales to have a substantial hagiographical dossier,\" says Prof Jane Cartwright, from the University of Wales Trinity St David. \"She was effectively a Welsh super saint whose cult extended beyond the Welsh border, since her relics were translated to Shrewsbury. \"She had two 12th Century Latin Lives and a 15th Century Welsh Life and she is one of the very few Welsh saints to make it into the Roman Martyrology. Prof Cartwright, who is editing the medieval Welsh life of St Winefride for the Cult of Saints in Wales project, which aims to publish a digital edition of some 100 medieval Welsh-language texts on saints, adds: \"In a sense her cult united England and Wales and she was deemed suitable to be venerated by royalty,\" At least six royal visitors - including Richard I, Edward IV and James II - have come to Holywell over the centuries. By far the most famous visit was by Henry V in 1416, who, having placed himself under the spiritual protection of St Winefride before the previous year's Battle of Agincourt - where his 6,000 men faced a French army six times the size - walked from Shrewsbury to the shrine to thank her for his victory. The precise date and route of the pilgrimage is unknown; in fact the only written record of it is in Latin, in the Chronicle of Adam of Usk so re-enacting the walk to commemorate its 600th anniversary has presented a challenge. \"There have been many attempts to work out the route,\" says walk organiser Ron Williams, from the Holywell Walkers are Welcome group. \"But when you think about it, there is only one way Henry V would have come. \"There weren't any roads except those the Romans had left and the Roman road comes to Llangollen from Shrewsbury, so that is most likely how he would have started off. \"On top of that he would have known that there was a Cistercian Abbey at Valle Crucis, so it's logical that he came there and if you look at a map, there's a direct line between Llangollen and Holywell so all we've done is put a walking route as near to that as possible. \"Of course we can't know it for sure but we think our route is more logical than those which have been put forward before. \"We have a good number of people walking the whole thing but we also want people to join in for the day so we've tried to make the walks easy to start and finish,\" adds Mr Williams. The walkers - including one dressed as Henry V - will be welcomed into Holywell on 24 June. The following day, the \"King\" will immerse himself in St Winefride's well. An interdenominational service, an afternoon of talks on St Winefride and a medieval festival - complete with storytellers, jesters, archery and combat displays - are also part of the anniversary celebrations. It is hoped the events will provide what festival organiser Mrs Owen claims is a \"much-needed\" boost for the Flintshire town. \"Holywell has been neglected,\" she said. \"It's like an unpolished diamond, a bit rough around the edges and it needs lots of little improvements. \"We want to get a much higher profile for the town with this - we want to really put it on the map.\" Kerry Feather, project director of  St Winefride's Well, agreed: \"We want the town and the well to benefit from the attention. \"We currently have around 35,000 visitors every year and we really would like to boost that number. \"Some people come here for healing but others just find it a place of peace and sanctuary, somewhere to spend time, whether it's in prayer or thought, in an oasis of calm in the middle of a very busy world.\" The organisers of this year's pilgrimage re-enactment also want it to have a lasting legacy - they have applied for Lottery funding for the creation of a new pilgrim's trail from Shrewsbury to Holywell, complete with waymarkers. \"Walking a pilgrim's trail is not just a walk, it's a different experience altogether,\" said Mr Williams. \"I'm not religious but you're walking in places where people have walked for centuries and it gets to you. \"You think, 'Why were they here, how did they get here, how did they feel?' \"It's quite an emotional experience and you get a real sense of connection to the history of the places along the route.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Six centuries ago Henry V walked from Shrewsbury to Holywell in Flintshire, to give thanks for his famous victory over the French at Agincourt.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: First, though, the German has to negotiate one of the most intense weekends of the year. The Brazilian Grand Prix throbs with a passion and fervour matched by few others. Interlagos and Sao Paulo are inextricably linked with Formula 1 even if the days of a winning Brazilian driver may be some time in the past. Brazil's first legendary grand prix driver, Emerson Fittipaldi, was born there, and his successes on the world stage laid the path for all others to follow. Ayrton Senna was, likewise, a Paulista, and is buried in Morumbi cemetery a few miles away. He was a hero to Rubens Barrichello, who grew up metres from the race track and forged his passion watching Senna there, before graduating to F1 a couple of years before his death, befriending him, and then taking up his mantle. Felipe Massa, another local boy, followed suit. The fans know the glory days have long gone, that a Brazilian victory is as unlikely as a day without a traffic jam in one of the world's most crowded cities. But still they come, packing the grandstands and singing and chanting from early in the day. What draws them there? A deep-seated passion for the sport, for one. The almost-certainty of a great sporting spectacle, for another. Interlagos has a knack for producing exciting races. Drama is synonymous with the track, not least because of its position at the business end of the season. It is a claustrophobic place. The circuit winds around a natural amphitheatre, high on a hill, the sprawl of Sao Paulo both a backdrop and crushing in from all sides. The heavy humidity, and almost-permanent threat of rain, add to the atmosphere. It feels locked in, and not just because of the cramped old paddock, a fraction of the size of anything Bernie Ecclestone finds acceptable these days. The track is a splash of vibrant green in an ocean of concrete grey and smog brown; the city butting up against the perimeter fence, endless tower blocks filling the skyline. Twenty years ago, a favela sprawled up the hill all the way to the perimeter wall. There has been an attempt to spruce things up a bit, the old corrugated-roof shacks replaced by flats closest to the circuit, houses of naked breeze blocks a bit further down the road. But down at heel, to say the least, it remains. There is an unmistakable edge. The road up to Interlagos is not a place for a stranger to linger. Inside, the track feels like a haven. One of the shortest laps on the calendar somehow packs in a long straight - superb for overtaking - and a challenging sequence of long corners, the best the uphill double right-hander of Ferra Dura/Laranha and the fast downhill left of Mergulho. It's a great race track, with emphasis on the \"race\". They are corners with a history - the new track is about half of the old one. Part of a previous era, it was a magnificent five miles of twists and turns, uphill and down, which started with two incredible, banked, high-speed left-handers, taken absolutely flat out by some, still visible outside the modern Turns One, Two and Three. It all adds to the character of the place. Loud, intimidating, crazy, invigorating, rough-around-the-edges. But, in its own way, brilliant.

The CPS said the case had been kept under regular review and prosecutors were no longer satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction. Defence counsel Ann Cotcher QC told the court Mr Varney had been \"removed from his attempts at education\" at Keele because of the proceedings against him. \"This is an allegation that goes back to 2014,\" Ms Cotcher told the brief hearing. \"The defendant was interviewed, as was the complainant, in March 2015, almost exactly two years ago.\" Following the hearing, Mr Varney offered his condolences to the family of Ms Stubbs. In a statement read out by his solicitor, Hollie Alcock, Mr Varney said: \"This is not a time of celebration for me - quite simply, I should never have been charged and put through this horrendous ordeal.\" He also called for a change in the law to provide anonymity to those charged with but not convicted of sexual offences. In a statement, Ms Stubbs' parents, Paul and Mandy Stubbs, said: \"We don't want what happened to Hannah to define her life or our memory of the kind and loving person that she was.\" An inquest recorded a narrative verdict that she had taken her own life following post-traumatic stress.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The mythical ruler's legendary court has been associated with locations throughout Wales, including Carmarthen, St David's, and Cardigan. Now a retired Bangor University professor has revealed what he believes to be the true location of Camelot. And it turns out to be a small Roman fort at Slack, on the outskirts of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. Prof Peter Field, a renowned expert in Arthurian literature, said:  \"It was quite by chance. I was looking at some maps, and suddenly all the ducks lined up. \"I believe I may have solved a 1,400-year-old mystery.\" Previous best guesses for the location of the round table include Caerleon in Newport, Somerset's Cadbury Castle, and Tintagel in Cornwall. In Roman times, Slack was home to a fort called Camulodunum, which means \"the fort of the god Camul\". Over the years, well-recognised linguistic processes would have reduced Camulodunum to Camelot. Though almost forgotten and insignificant today, and even though it was abandoned and dilapidated by the relevant time of King Arthur around A.D. 500, Prof Field argues that this site at Slack would still have been considered a strategic stronghold. At that time, Celtic-speaking Britons, who could have been led by King Arthur, held the north and the west coast against the invading Anglo-Saxons. Slack, on the Roman road from Chester to York, would have been the ideal location from which to defend the east coast. Prof Field added: \"If there was a real King Arthur, he will have lived around AD500, although the first mention of him in Camelot is in a French poem from the Champagne region of France from 1180. \"There is no mention of Camelot in the period between those dates, known as the Dark Ages, when the country was at war, and very little was recorded. \"In this gap, people passed on information, much got lost in transmission, and people may have made up facts or just messed up known information.\" Prof Field, who taught at Bangor from 1964 to 2004, has been researching the location of Camelot for the past 18 months.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The latest intake of Tory MPs is far and away the most Eurosceptic in the Conservative Party's history. Almost all of the pro-European \"big beasts\" of the Thatcher/Major years - men like Chris Patten and Michael Heseltine - are long gone from front-line politics. According to Tim Montgomerie, the assiduous student of backbench opinion who writes for the website Conservative Home, a third of those now on the Conservative benches would like to see a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Europe, and another third would like Britain to come out altogether. The estimate of more than a hundred outright \"withdrawalists\" - Conservatives who essentially believe in the European policy of the UK Independence Party - suggests many Tory MPs are being coy about what they really believe. Only ten Conservative MPs have declared their position publicly, by joining the \"Better Off Out\" group, which campaigns openly for withdrawal. Today Euroscepticism is the iceberg of Tory politics; only the top is visible, but a large and - for the leadership - possibly dangerous mass lies beneath the water. That impression is reinforced by the fact that two of the MPs I interviewed for BBC Radio 4's Analysis would talk only on condition we concealed their identity. One of them told me that even though his views are, he believes, now \"mainstream\" in his party, he still sees support for EU withdrawal in Wildean terms as \"the love that dare not speak its name\". The other complained of a \"supine approach\" to Europe by the Party's leadership since it came into government. When the Conservatives were in opposition, David Cameron made a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that, should he be elected Prime Minister, he would hold a referendum on any EU Treaty that emerged, as \"no treaty should be ratified without consulting the British people in a referendum\". The Lisbon treaty was ratified by all EU states before the 2010 general election, but critics maintain that David Cameron reneged on his promise. \"The collateral damage from that broken promise\", our un-nameable MP said, \"is a bit of a black cloud over the government even now\". Could the government ship be heading towards a collision with the Eurosceptic iceberg? There are signs of new currents of opinion on Europe swirling through the left of British politics too. Last year, during the Labour leadership campaign, Ed Balls questioned one of the principles at the heart of the EU and its single market, the free movement of labour. Mr Balls, now shadow chancellor, said he wanted to stop \"the practice where people can work in our country and send benefits back to their own countries\". That theme has been picked up by Lord Glasman, the driving force behind the Blue Labour movement - which aims to revitalise the party's traditional grassroots support - and an influential adviser to the Labour leader Ed Miliband. Maurice Glasman argues against the current EU rules which, he says, encourage people in poorer member states to leave their families to work overseas, arguing the practice can depress workers' incomes in richer economies. He told Analysis he would be happy to make common cause with Tory Eurosceptics if he concluded it would advance his cause. All these factors suggest that Europe could soon occupy centre stage in British politics once again. And the crisis in the eurozone has offered a golden opportunity to those pushing the government to engage in debate about Europe. Douglas Carswell, Tory backbench MP for Clacton in Essex, and one of the small group of Better Off Out MPs, argues that the eurozone crisis has destroyed the economic case for EU membership: \"Far from joining a prosperous trading bloc\", he says, \"we shackled ourselves to a corpse. We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join.\" But Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament. Tory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw. There is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority. \"So long as Britain is in an economic crisis\", says Tim Montgomerie, \"every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity.\" Analysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST Download the Analysis podcast Listen via the Radio 4 website Follow Analysis on Facebook Last month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy. The meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for \"new thinking\" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal. One of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described \"this in-or-out discussion\" as \"a bit crude\", and said she thinks the choice is between \"the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship\". The wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself. Almost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart. That in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works. Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply \"wave goodbye\" altogether. And Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public. It is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015. Those MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Lib Dem leader said the Tories would have to cut 10,000 police officers, 28,000 carers and 25,000 military personnel to pay for the tax cuts promised by George Osborne. He said the poorest would \"bear the heaviest burden\". David Cameron has accused Mr Clegg of \"running away from his record\". The Lib Dems have announced that they want to raise the income tax threshold to \u00a312,500 by 2020, which would be funded partly by using the proceeds of measures to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion. Mr Clegg said the Tory plans to raise the income tax personal allowance to \u00a312,500, and also increase the 40p rate threshold to \u00a350,000 by 2020 would cost more than \u00a37bn. At a press conference at the National Liberal Club in London, Mr Clegg said: \"To find that money they will have to do what Tories do best - cut. \"Gone are the days of compassionate conservatism. Now they promise to cut and cut and cut. Not because they have to, but because they want to. \"As George Osborne has said, the Conservatives will cut much deeper than is necessary to balance the books and make the poorest bear the heaviest burden. \"But at the same time they are promising tax giveaways for the wealthy, all of which must be paid for by yet more cuts to public spending. \"In the firing line are parents and police officers, soldiers and social workers.\" This issue includes the wider economy and deficit reduction but also employment and the role of business. Policy guide: Where the parties stand But in an article in The Daily Telegraph Mr Cameron told the newspaper that Mr Clegg's attacks on him will fail, he said: \"I don't think it works because you can't run on your record and run away from your record at the same time.\" Mr Clegg also went on to criticise Labour and said Ed Miliband's plans for the deficit would mean an extra \u00a3134 from every taxpayer being spent on debt interest payments. \"If the Conservatives will cut too much, Labour will borrow too much. \"Labour will borrow \u00a370bn more than we will - meaning an extra \u00a34bn just to pay the interest on our debt,\" he said. His sentiments were echoed by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander who said the \"common thread\" running through the Lib Dem approach to tax was fairness. He said: \"Fairness means that everyone should pay their taxes, zero tolerance of evasion and aggressive avoidance. Fairness means that as we finish the job of balancing the books, we should ask those who have the most to contribute to most.\" But in response to Mr Clegg's claims Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said nobody could trust the Lib Dems. He said: \"They broke their promise not to raise VAT on families and pensioners and backed the Tory tax cut for millionaires. \"For all their claims, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies says families have lost \u00a31,100 a year on average when all this government's changes are taken into account - including the changes to the personal allowance. Like the Tories, the Lib Dems give with one hand but take much more with the other hand. \"Labour's plan will back working people with fully funded tax cuts and reverse the Tory and Lib Dem tax giveaway for millionaires to balance the books in a fair way.\" Meanwhile, in an interview with The Economist, Nick Clegg has said that many of the voters who have stopped supporting his party \"want to be entirely bereft of any responsibility\". He told the publication: \"There is clearly a section of the support we had in 2010 that was virulently anti-Conservative. \"They're the ones who still scream and shout blue murder and have done so without pause for breath for half a decade. \"And they're loud and they're noisy and they're angry.

The AM for North Wales sits as an independent in the Senedd after falling out with the UKIP assembly group leader Neil Hamilton. UKIP's ruling national executive committee had earlier agreed to hold a ballot of Welsh members on whether Mr Gill should continue to be both an AM and an MEP.

Producers of the reality television show have denied that. Now, one charity which accused the makers of misrepresenting residents has offered a solution: a self-defence kit against unwanted advances. Oasis, a community and education charity, runs the primary school in Birmingham where Benefits Street was filmed. Reverend Steve Chalke, who founded Oasis, said that other communities have approached them asking for advice on what to do if they get attention from reality TV producers. He said: \"We can't proactively defend every community in the country. \"However, we believe that the new self-defence kit will give people the chance to benefit from what we've learnt.\" The kit, which is on its website, contains advice on how to discourage television producers. It also has what it calls a \"decoder\" to translate what a producer might really mean if they describe the programme they want to make. Despite more than 900 complaints, watchdog Ofcom ruled that Channel 4 did not breach the broadcasting code. A second series is thought to be under way in Teesside. A Channel 4 spokesperson said: \"We are always transparent and clear with residents in the extensive briefings that are given pre-filming and operate highly robust duty of care protocols for contributors which were praised by the regulator Ofcom as 'demonstrating best practice'. \"Filming of the second series recently began in Stockton-On-Tees, many months after transmission of the first and the subsequent media reaction, so residents were already familiar with the nature and profile of the programme. \"The majority of them have been happy to co-operate and support filming, even in the face of external pressure put on them by vested interests outside of the street.\" Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Despite being a ratings winner for Channel 4, Benefits Street came with its fair share of complaints.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Up to 10,000 prison officers in England and Wales protested last month over claims of a \"surge\" in jail violence. They stopped work over claims of a \"surge in violence\" in jails but returned to work after a High Court injunction ordered them to end their 24-hour protest. Under the agreement, prison officers will be allowed to retire at 65 - up to three years ahead of the current state pension age - at no cost to them and with full pension benefits. Uniformed staff will also be given consolidated pay rises of between 0.5% and 1% for each of the next three years, on top of usual performance-related pay increases. They also stand to receive a \"recognition and retention\" package totalling \u00c2\u00a31,000. Prisons minister Sam Gyimah, said the government and POA had also \"agreed a significant number of health and safety reforms as well as new powers for governors in terms of how they deploy their staff in prisons\". The POA directed members to take action last month after talks with the government over health and safety concerns broke down. It came after multiple high-profile incidents at prisons across England. In October, Jamal Mahmoud, an inmate at HMP Pentonville, died after being stabbed to death in an attack at the prison, which left two others injured.

But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was \"fairly obvious grandstanding\" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. \"It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,\" the source said.

Officers said a low brick wall had been built inside the outhouse with three layers of concrete placed over the body. A post-mortem examination found My Borgye died from hammer blows to the head. He had been reported missing by a work colleague, but after launching an investigation police said they believed he had left the country. Det Sgt Steve Currie said the case had been \"complicated\" and \"devastating\" for Mr Borgye's family, but added \"the final jigsaw piece in this shocking crime is now in place\".

{"article": "###\nArticle: \"None of the computers or machines worked except for the General Electric-powered machines like the MRIs [magnetic resonance imaging],\" recalled Mykhailo Radutskyi, president of the Boris Clinic - Kiev's largest medical clinic. His radiologists decided to turn off the body scanners anyway as a precautionary measure after the building's IT system went down at two o'clock in the morning in late June. Doctors across the centre had to resort to taking records solely by paper and pen for the first time since the mid-1990s. \"The main problem for us was that Ukrainian law requires us to keep all our patient info for 25 years, and we lost that medical documentation for the 24 hours when our systems were down,\" Mr Radutskyi divulged. \"But thankfully we keep back-ups, so we didn't lose any information.\" All in all, Mr Radutskyi reckons his clinic's damage tally totalled $60,000 (\u00c2\u00a346,000). Others have been unwilling to reveal how badly they were hit. Oschadbank - one of the country's biggest lenders - was among those that declined an interview with the BBC. Even now, almost a month after the so-called NotPetya strike, some companies inside and outside the nation are still facing disruption. Ukraine's top cyber-cop disclosed that some of the nation's largest companies were still too scared to share the full scale of the fallout with his investigators. And Sergiy Demedyuk - head of Ukraine's ministry of internal affairs' cybercrime division - added he has come to believe there are aftershocks still to come since the hackers appear to have compromised their targets for some time before they pounced, and might still be sitting on data they could yet exploit. NotPetya initially appeared to be a ransomware attack, but many now suspect its blackmail demands were a cover for something more ominous. Experts who have spoken to the BBC are seemingly sure of two things: first, Ukraine was the target, and second, it was not about money. Despite denials, suspicion has fallen on Ukraine's eastern neighbour, Russia. \"Cyber-attacks are just one part of Russia's wider efforts to destabilise the country,\" Nato's former chief civil servant Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the BBC. \"In my time as secretary general we agreed that a cyber-attack could trigger Nato's mutual defence clause. \"The Alliance has been assisting Ukraine especially with monitoring and investigating security incidents. However... more support is also needed for prevention.\" One cybersecurity veteran has been investigating how a local software developer's program, MeDoc, came to be hijacked to spread the malware. \"It wasn't just [a case of] take over MeDoc's update server and push out NotPetya,\" explained Nicholas Weaver from University of California, Berkeley. \"Instead, they had previously compromised MeDoc, made it into a remote-control Trojan, and then they were willing to burn this asset to launch this attack,\" he added, referring to the fact the servers have since been confiscated by the police. \"That really is huge.\" MeDoc's tax filing services were used by more than 400,000 customers across Ukraine, representing about 90% of its domestic firms. Although it was not mandatory for local companies to use it, by virtue of its ubiquity, it's almost as if it were. \"This was gold they had, basically a control point in almost every business that does business in Ukraine,\" said Mr Weaver. \"And they burned this resource in order to launch this destructive attack.\" Mr Demedyuk said his police force had concrete evidence that MeDoc was hacked a long time ago and had been used to spy on economic activity within Ukraine. \"The [developers] claimed on their website that it was certificated, that it had been examined with international audit and it's 100% safe. In fact, it wasn't true,\" he added. One ex-US Army cyber-expert said the hackers might have felt forced to carry out their attack through fear that MeDoc's computer servers were about to slip out of their control. \"If you read [security firm] ESET's report, you see that they gained and lost access repeatedly as legitimate MeDocs updates were pushed,\" Jon Nichols said. \"It is possible that the actors just wanted to cause as much damage as they could before they lost control again.\" This theory is backed up by another US expert. \"It's not unheard of if you think you'll lose your position to launch prematurely,\" said Beau Woods deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative. He added that if the perpetrators had, indeed, gathered financial data about most of Ukraine's companies, they might still find ways to cause further damage. Mr Demedyuk said that although only four police officers had been assigned to his NotPetya investigation full-time, he had about 300 people across Ukraine supporting the inquiry. Furthermore, he has met with Interpol to discuss ways to share information with other international authorities. While they try to unravel how the attack was carried out, others are preparing for follow-up cyber-assaults. In particular, the chief executive of Ukraine's state-owned energy giant Ukrenergo is concerned it will be a target. \"All our life as an independent country in the last 25 years, we've been connected to the Russian power grid and they've balanced us,\" Vsevolod Kovalchuk told the BBC. However, he explained, an agreement his firm has struck with European electricity transmission operators to modernise Ukraine's power grid might have put the firm in Moscow's cross-hairs. It might sound like paranoia, but Ukrenergo had already been hit by two cyber-attacks prior to NotPetya. One occurred just before Christmas. \"That virus worked in our local network for over one year,\" Mr Kovalchuk said. \"It collected information and after collecting the information, the hackers put another malware specific for our northern substation and switched it off for 15 minutes. It was only a test but they tried and it was successful.\" Before that Ukrenergo was caught up in the infamous Black Energy attack, in December 2015. It took down half a city's power for three hours in the dead of winter. The two incidents meant the firm was already battle-hardened when it was infected by NotPetya. \"A dispatcher called me and said they couldn't do anything because all of their screens had turned black and were asking for money,\" recalled Mr Kovalchuk. \"That was at 11:02 EET [Eastern European Time], and then several minutes later, other computers were in the same situation so I called to my chief IT officer and asked what is this, is this WannaCry or something similar?\" he said referring to a ransomware attack that disrupted the NHS and others in May. \"We disconnected our networks, switched off our computers, and then we used our protocols from the past, using paper standards, phones and continued to operate without any computers, without databases, without any systems.\" This time round, the electricity grid was unharmed and power flowed uninterrupted. But the company was left without secondary functions for 10 days. For Ukraine, the most important questions from here on seem to be: How bad does an attack have to be before serious international attention is paid to it? And: At what point does it become a war crime? \"I think that every six months, we'll see attacks,\" predicted Prof Michael Schmitt, lead author of the Tallinn Manual - the definitive international legal guide to cyber-conflict. \"Even though I'm not 100% sure that it's Russia, I don't understand which other country could attack Ukraine. It's the only logical answer.\" And Ukrainian cybersecurity experts like Alexey Yankovski believe every single business is at risk. \"Ukraine is a playground for attacks, and a large part of the cyber-security community here believes that most of the companies have already been infected,\" he told the BBC. \"Every company here should be prepared for the fact that it will be hacked sooner or later.\" This week BBC News is taking a close look at all aspects of cyber-security.

He is believed to have flown in from Dubai rather than taking a direct flight from Cape Town to the UK. He was extradited in April for the trial, which was thrown out on Monday. Judge Jeanette Traverso cleared Mr Dewani after ruling the prosecution case that the care home boss from Bristol had arranged the death of his wife Anni was flawed. Armed police officers were on guard at the airport preventing reporters from approaching the exit used by Mr Dewani. He is believed to have flown into the UK on an Emirates flight that landed shortly before 06:30. Judge Traverso dismissed the case against Mr Dewani at the Western Cape High Court, describing evidence from a key prosecution witness as \"riddled with contradictions\". Mr Dewani had always denied plotting to arrange the shooting of his bride in the back of their taxi while on honeymoon in November four years ago. His wife's family, from Sweden, are now considering whether to launch a civil action against her husband in the UK. They said the decision left many questions unanswered as it meant bisexual Mr Dewani, who led a double life visiting male prostitutes in the months before he married, would not have to give evidence or face cross-examination. Her uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said they would make a decision on legal action after the Christmas holiday. Judge Traverso ruled it was not necessary for Mr Dewani to give evidence, saying a defendant was entitled to be discharged if there was no possibility of conviction unless he entered the witness box and incriminated himself. She said claims by the chief prosecution witness, cab driver Zola Tongo, about the murder were also \"highly debatable\" and the evidence from the prosecution was \"far below\" the required threshold. Three men - Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and gunman Xolile Mngeni - have already been convicted for their part in the murder, which happened during a late-night tour of a township when their chauffeur-driven car was hijacked. Monde Mbolombo, a self-confessed \"middle man\" who set up the murder, may also face justice having previously been granted immunity by the state. The prosecution claimed Mr Dewani wanted to get out of his relationship with Anni, 28, and arranged a car-jacking in which she would be killed.

Immigration minister James Brokenshire said he hoped the DFT system would resume within weeks. It is thought about 800 applicants are affected - and can now seek bail. Of those, it is estimated that about 100 may have to be released. The system, introduced in 2000, accelerates legal hearings and appeals while keeping the individual detained. It is used in cases which officials believe can be decided quickly. Last month the Court of Appeal ordered the Home Office to halt the system immediately after an earlier High Court hearing concluded it contained \"structural unfairness\". High Court judge Mr Justice Nicol put a \"legal stay\" - a temporary delay - on his ruling on 12 June, following a case brought by campaign group Detention Action. This meant the fast-track system remained in operation until the government had exhausted all opportunities to appeal. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said officials were worried their procedures were not as robust as they should be. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the system had \"come under significant legal challenge\". \"Risks surrounding the safeguards within the system for particularly vulnerable applicants have also been identified to the extent that we cannot be certain of the level of risk of unfairness to certain vulnerable applicants who may enter DFT. \"In light of these issues, I have decided to temporarily suspend the operation of the detained fast-track policy. \"I hope this pause to be short in duration, perhaps only a matter of weeks, but I will only resume operation of this policy when I am sure the right structures are in place to minimise any risk of unfairness.\" The decision to suspend the process means those asylum seekers detained and awaiting hearings will be reassessed at a \"senior level\" to see if they can be released from detention to continue their asylum application in the normal way. Mr Brokenshire added: \"Those who meet the general criteria for detention will not be directly affected by the decision to suspend DFT. \"Many are already detained under these powers, for example because they are at risk of absconding and face imminent removal. \"Only if detention can no longer be justified outside a DFT process will applicants be released to continue their asylum claim in the regular asylum system.\" He said applicants who face removal to a safe third country, pose a risk to the public or are foreign offenders are \"still liable to be detained or remain detained\".

{"article": "###\nArticle: For all that it may sound attractive to the Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish to have greater influence over their respective economic destinies, presumably that would be less desirable if at a stroke they became poorer. The point is that as and when there is an English parliament for English people - of the sort that the former Tory minister John Redwood has been demanding, and David Cameron seemed to concede today - the financial transfer from England to the rest of the UK may be harder to sustain. So these constitutional reforms will be tricky, if not dangerous - if at least a part of the current glue that holds the UK together is a redistribution of resources from England to the rest, and that glue is progressively removed. Being British right now means in part that public services and living standards are not too far apart in quantum and quality wherever you happen to live. But what if the overhaul of the UK's budget-making or fiscal constitution waters down that glue. How much is at stake? Well, spending on public-sector services per head is highest in Northern Ireland, \u00a310,900 and it is lowest in England, at \u00a38,500. The figure for Scotland - beneficiary of the famous or notorious Barnett Formula, which formalises an income transfer from England to Scotland - is \u00a310,200. So expenditure on public services in Scotland is a fifth higher per person than south of the border, and it is 28% higher in Northern Ireland. In Wales, the increment on public-service spending is 14% - which the Welsh have often complained is too little, compared with the transfer of income to Scotland. Now one way of looking at the scale of the transfer is to look at the amount of income - or what is known as gross value added - generated in each country. So English gross value added per head is highest, at just under \u00a322,000, and it is lowest in Wales at \u00a315,400. The English enjoy public-service spending per annum equivalent to under 40% of the income they generate, whereas annual outlays on public services in Wales are equivalent to more than 60% of nationally generated income per head. The ratios for Scotland and Northern Ireland are just over 50% and not far off 70% respectively. In a UK of considerable social and cultural solidarity that prevailed for most of the twentieth century, these sorts of disparities between income and outlay between the nations were relatively uncontroversial: they captured the idea that all UK citizens are in it together, as it were. But today it seems almost inevitable that in David Cameron's brave new world of greater national fiscal self-determination, some English nationalist MPs on the right of the spectrum may increasingly view Wales - and Scotland and Northern Ireland - as de facto socialist paradises excessively featherbedded by the English. That said, if the nations are given much greater control over income taxes - which appears to be what is on offer - could they not pay for whatever public services they feel they need out of these locally levied taxes? Not remotely. Income and other direct taxes per head in Wales raise \u00a35,564, considerably less than the UK average of \u00a37,360, and nowhere near enough to cover public service expenditure. There is a similar mismatch between direct income taxes and public spending throughout the UK. Borrowing and indirect taxes, mostly VAT, make up the difference. And there is not the faintest chance that national parliaments will be given the power to increase VAT, because this would be an admin nightmare for businesses and undermine the UK as a frictionless single market. All of which means that it may sound exciting and empowering in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland to make their own choices about taxing and spending. But it may also be a bit nerve-wracking (or worse) if it provides cover for Westminster to reduce the income transferred to them from English taxpayers.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The big question about the Prime Minister's plan to hand more control over taxes, spending and welfare to the four nations is how far this would end the subsidy of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by England, and especially by London and the South East.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: It was back in 2008, and James Watt and Martin Dickie's then tiny brewery at Fraserburgh, north-east Scotland, was little over a year old and struggling. Selling their US-style craft beers from the back of their van at farmers' markets, they were missing payments on their \u00a320,000 ($30,000) bank loan. \"We were selling a couple of cases on a good day, and losing money,\" says Mr Watt, now 32. And then they decided to enter a bottled beer competition organised by supermarket group Tesco. BrewDog won first, second, third, and fourth place. \"So we went down to Tesco's headquarters [just north of London], and they told us they loved our beer and wanted to put us in 500 shops, buying 2,000 cases a week,\" says Mr Watt. \"We put on our best poker faces and said 'no problem'. Yet we were just two guys filling bottles by hand.\" With Tesco wanting first deliveries in four months' time, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie, also now 32, went to their bank to ask for another \u00a3150,000, so they could quickly install a bottling line, and expand production. But failing to meet the payments on their existing loan, the bank said a firm \"no\". So the business partners went to another lender, and lied. Mr Watt says: \"We said that our bank had offered us an amazing deal, but that if you can match it we'll switch, and they went for it. You have got to do what you have to do.\" With BrewDog now being able to increase its brewing facilities, it was able to start supplying Tesco on time with bottles of its Punk IPA. The beer was an immediate hit, and the other UK supermarkets soon followed suit. Fast forward to 2014, and BrewDog is due to see its turnover top \u00a332m this year. It employs 357 people, and as well as continuing to supply the likes of Tesco UK-wide, it owns 25 bars, 18 across the UK, and seven abroad. And now based at a larger brewery down the road in the town of Ellon, it exports to 52 countries. Childhood friends who grew up in the Scottish town of Peterhead, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie started brewing beer together as a hobby in their early 20s. At the time Mr Watt was working as a deep sea fisherman, while Mr Dickie was a whisky distiller. From the very start they were inspired to brew American-style craft beers - sweet-tasting ales with high alcohol levels and very large amounts of US hops, which gave them a bold, fruity, even perfumed flavour. They are very Marmite beers in that you either love them or hate them. To fans they are flavoursome and interesting, to critics they are undrinkable. Yet, confident they could convert drinkers, and after some good reviews, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie decided to quit their day jobs and start brewing professionally in 2007. \"Even though the first year was tough, we never lost faith in what we were doing,\" says Mr Watt. \"We were hell-bent... we were stupidly ambitious.\" In addition to the bold flavours, the two men also worked hard on creating an irreverent brand image for BrewDog, giving their beers fun names, and bright, colourful labels. Some of their other brews are called Dead Pony Pale Ale, Dogma and Hardcore IPA. Expansion has been made possible after the business raised \u00a37m via crowdfunding, with 15,000 people paying \u00a395 for a stake in the company. In return they get discounts in BrewDog's bars, and other perks. In more controversial matters, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie have also regularly - and enthusiastically - attacked regulators and industry bodies. Their critics say they do so simply to garner publicity, but Mr Watt says they are merely sticking up for themselves. Earlier this year the Portman Group, the UK drinks industry trade body that promotes responsible drinking, criticised BrewDog, saying that the label of the brewery's Dead Pony Pale Ale promoted anti-social behaviour and binge drinking. BrewDog's response at the time was as follows: \"Unfortunately, the Portman Group is a gloomy gaggle of killjoy jobsworths, funded by navel-gazing international drinks giants.\" When contacted by the BBC for this article, a spokesman for the Portman Group said: \"BrewDog's business model has traditionally used complaints by the public as a PR opportunity for their brands. \"BrewDog and the Portman Group have a long history... we don't expect them to like us, but we were pleased to see they have started relabeling their products.\" There are no hard and fast rules on what makes a \"craft beer\". However, typically it is a natural beer made by a small brewery, often with large amounts of pungent hops and a marked sweetness from the barley malt So what is the difference between \"craft beer\" and \"real ale\"? Unlike craft beer, real ale - as determined by UK pressure group Campaign For Real Ale - has to be unpasteurised and unfiltered. Real ale also more often has a drier flavour. Craft beer is also typically served well chilled and carbonated, whereas real ales are served less cold and have no added gas Yet, like lager (which itself can be a craft beer or real ale), they share the same basic four ingredients - malted barley, hops, yeast and water. In all cases other ingredients can be added on top, such as different grains A similar dispute that BrewDog had in 2013 with the UK's advertising watchdog, the ASA, saw Mr Watt call the officials \"killjoy, self-important pen pushers\". BrewDog has also been criticised for selling some beers with exceptionally high alcohol rates, such as a limited edition ale that was 55% alcohol. Mr Watt says that he and Mr Dickie - who together own a 75% share of the business - remain unrepentant, and simply \"make beers that we want to drink ourselves\". Mr Watt adds that BrewDog's products are bought by beer aficionados, and priced at a premium. He says that if someone is going to abuse alcohol they will be the cheaper, mass market beers that give drinkers \"maximum bang for their buck\". With exports now making up 65% of sales, Mr Watt says they have no plans to slow down the fast-paced growth. \"My worry is that we aren't growing fast enough,\" he says.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "When the founders of popular but controversial beer company BrewDog needed a second bank loan to enable them to expand production, their tactic was a simple one - lie through their teeth.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

US states take aim at NSA facilities The latest verdict, by the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, came after New York District Judge William Pauley had dismissed a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which argued that the way the NSA tracked million of calls contravened the US constitution. The 97-page ruling says that \"a provision of the USA Patriot Act permitting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to collect business records deemed relevant to a counterterrorism investigation cannot be legitimately interpreted to permit the systematic bulk collection of domestic calling records\". However, the appeals court stopped short of ruling on the constitutionality of the programme, launched after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US. The Snowden revelations in June 2013 caused an international outcry, despite US administrations insisting the programme has been fully authorised. The measures - repeatedly approved in secret by a national security court since 2006 - are set to expire on 1 June. Leaders of the lower US House of Representatives would prefer to pass a bill to end the government's bulk collection of phone records and replace it with legislation that supporters say protects civil liberties. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he wants to extend the Patriot Act and retain the bulk collection programme. The White House supports \"an alternative mechanism to preserve the program's essential capabilities without the government holding the bulk data\", said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council.

{"article": "###\nArticle: On Monday it emerged a pit bull named Stella had been kept in a 3ft by 9ft cage for two years without exercise. Now former kennel workers have released a video showing both Stella and a seized Rottweiler named Vinnie. Devon and Cornwall Police said \"immensely frustrating\" delays in the judicial process left Vinnie in kennels for two years before he was destroyed. The video, taken on the day Vinnie was put down, shows kennel staff playing with Vinnie while Stella, in the kennel next door, rubs noses with the Rottweiler through the metal mesh. The BBC understands Vinnie had been trained as a guard dog and police said he was used to attack three people in 2013. He was seized and placed in kennels but the court process took two years before a destruction order was carried out around 26 July 2015. Former staff at the kennels say Vinnie had a \"Do Not Enter\" sign on his kennel and, as far as they were aware, was not let out for a period of two years. Laura Khanlarian, who until December 2015 worked as an assistant at the private kennel used by Devon and Cornwall Police, said: \"To move him from one cage to another he just went through the internal doors. \"He wasn't assessed like Stella so he really didn't leave the kennel at all. \"Vinnie had no contact until the day he was put down. I made that video an hour before when we were allowed in his kennel with him.\" Another former worker at the kennel, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Vinnie the Rottie had no human contact except being fed. He was deemed too dangerous to get out. \"But this was the dog that, once he knew you, wagged his tail, pushing himself against the bars, desperate for any attention. \"As far as I know he belonged to a man who trained him as a guard dog. Because he was possibly trained to bite we were told not to walk, go in with him, same as Stella as he was too dangerous.\" Former staff at the kennels have told the BBC they offered to work with Vinnie and exercise him but were not given permission to do so. After the BBC revealed Stella's plight, Devon and Cornwall Police Chief Superintendent Jim Nye said: \"The welfare of dogs is extremely important to us. \"In the past year we have seized in the region of 100 dogs, and only Stella has been assessed as too dangerous and unpredictable for kennel staff to walk.\" Following the release of the latest video, the force did not say if they or another body had ordered Vinnie - who is understood to not be among the last 100 dogs seized - to be kept without human contact. However, in a statement they said: \"Vinnie the Rottweiler was a dog seized and placed into kennels in 2013. \"Vinnie was a legal breed and was seized after it had bitten three people. Later the courts granted a destruction order on the dog who was put to sleep in the early to mid part of 2015. \"Within the last 100 dogs we have seized only Stella was deemed too dangerous to be exercised and instructions given to the kennel specifically in relation to this. \"It is important to stress that despite the very best effort of the police, the judicial process is not accelerated when a dog is placed in kennels.

He spoke out after Labour was hit by a row over its stance on welfare cuts. He also criticised Jeremy Corbyn, amid reports that he is doing well in the race to be Labour leader. In an interview with BBC Newsnight political editor Allegra Stratton, Mr Umunna said Labour were \"sent a very strong message\" by the electorate at the general election, where it was almost wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and failed to make ground on the Conservatives in England. \"We're running around stamping our feet, screaming at the electorate when ultimately what we need to do is meet people where they are at, not necessarily where we would want them to be,\" he said. Labour has been divided by how to respond to the welfare cuts set out in George Osborne's Budget, with some MPs reacting angrily when acting leader Harriet Harman said it should not oppose all of the measures. The party's new leader will be announced at a special conference in September. Mr Umunna, who was briefly in the leadership contest before withdrawing, said the Conservatives would want Mr Corbyn to win. The odds on Mr Corbyn winning the leadership have recently been reduced, though he only made it on to the ballot paper after some MPs not thought to be his supporters agreed to make up the necessary number of nominations for him. Mr Umunna said he had nothing against the Islington North MP but added that his political views were not \"a politics that can win\". He said Mr Corbyn was \"weak on defence at a time when global insecurity is rising\" and backed \"more generous social security payments for people who can work but refuse to work\". \"I'll tell you what, there is no glory in opposition,\" Mr Umunna added. \"Ultimately we will betray our people if we don't get elected.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has accused his Labour Party colleagues of \"behaving like a petulant child who has been told you can't have the sweeties in the sweet shop\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Mr Trump broke a long-held tradition by not releasing his paperwork during his presidential campaign. His critics want to know who he has been dealing with and if there are any conflicts of interest. At least 21 people were arrested in Berkeley, California, in clashes between Trump opponents and supporters. There is no law requiring presidents to release their tax returns, but Mr Trump has found himself under public pressure and  some information from a 2005 tax return was leaked to the media last month. The protests were timed to coincide with the traditional mid-April deadline for Americans to file their tax returns. \"I think it is critical we know about his investments, his donations and any entanglements he has,\" said one protester, Chuck Wash, at a march in Washington DC. The idea for the themed march came from law professor Jennifer Taub, who was angered when presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said President Trump would not be releasing his tax returns because \"people don't care\". In January, Ms Taub tweeted of the need for a nationwide protest to show the president that many people do care. The idea quickly caught on. \"I wanted to express myself and never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be standing here today, seeing this idea that I tweeted out in January come to life,\" she told the BBC at the Washington DC march. Ms Taub said the march had broader aims than just wanting to see the president's paperwork. \"This is also about having a tax system that is fair,\" she said. \"Both in terms of making sure everyone pays their fair share and also in taking public resources - our taxes - and spending them on things that make everyone flourish.\" She said less should be spent on wars, and more should go to public service television and the Meals on Wheels programme, which Mr Trump has made funding cuts to in the first months of his presidency. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, was also at the march in Washington DC. She said the Trump administration has a \"huge\" transparency problem. \"He [Trump] talked about draining the swamp and making everything transparent. He lied again,\" said Ms Waters. She also criticised Friday's announcement that President Donald Trump will not release the logs of those who visit the White House. The White House cited \"grave national security risks and privacy concerns\" as the reason for its decision, reversing former President Barack Obama's voluntary disclosure policy. Participants used the hashtag #showusyourtaxes to share their images on social media. President Trump's supporters have also gone online to express their support for the president. One Twitter user accused protesters of \"flogging a dead horse\" and many said they had no interest in seeing the returns. Separately, more than a dozen people were arrested in Berkeley, California, after supporters of Mr Trump clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators at a free speech rally, police said. Several people were injured when fighting broke out at a park in the city as opponents and supporters of the US president met on the streets during Saturday's protests, according to CNN. Footage shared on social media showed crowds of people throwing items at one another and demonstrators being attacked with what appeared to be chemical sprays and makeshift weapons. The incident occurred after hundreds of anti-Trump protesters staged a counter-rally alongside an event billed as a \"Patriots Day free speech rally and picnic\", organised by the president's supporters.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Protests have been taking place in more than 150 locations across the United States to call on President Donald Trump to release his tax returns.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn has said terms were almost agreed with former champion Klitschko and hoped the IBF, WBO and WBA titles would be contested. But Ruiz Jr's promoter Bob Arum said the WBO has sanctioned the Parker bout. The WBO is yet to confirm the decision but Arum is already considering venues and expects the match to take place in Parker's native New Zealand. The 24-year-old is undefeated in 21 fights and is the WBO's number-one ranked heavyweight, with Ukrainian Klitschko second. Mexico's Ruiz Jr, 27, is third on the list and has won all of his 29 bouts. Fury has vacated the WBO and WBA straps and had his boxing licence stripped by the British Boxing Board of Control \"pending further investigation into anti-doping and medical issues\". The 28-year-old, who defeated Klitschko in 2015, is suffering from depression and has admitted to taking cocaine. In November he also has an appeal hearing for a doping charge issued in July. It is unclear if the WBA will allow Joshua to compete for their version of the title, but Hearn says his fighter will be in action on 10 December even if Klitschko pursues a fight for the belt with a different opponent.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Northampton hooker is expected to be named skipper by new head coach Eddie Jones on Monday. Hartley has been banned for over a year in total during his career. But Rugby Football Union chief executive Ritchie said he had \"paid the penalty\", adding \"I don't think it precludes him [from being captain]\". Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Ritchie added: \"It is primarily a matter for the head coach, and I'm not going to hinder that in any way. \"It's a matter of balance and perspective, and Dylan I'm sure brings many positives as well to the set-up.\" Ritchie confirmed the RFU is monitoring the case of young flanker Sam Underhill, who plays for Welsh region Ospreys. The 19-year-old is English and is on the radar of England boss Jones, but is ineligible to be picked for his country while playing outside the English Premiership. Underhill - who has captained England at Under-18 level - is studying at Cardiff University and is contracted to Bridgend and the Ospreys. However, Ritchie says Underhill's case may be viewed differently to the likes of those who play in France, and that he may be treated as a special case given his age. \"I think we need to look at that, and we are having some discussions about that,\" Ritchie added. \"We want to keep people who have played in our age-grade teams, as he has. We maybe need to look at whether it is different for elite squads compared to development squads.\" Ritchie says French club Toulon's bid to join the Premiership is a \"long shot\". The Toulon president Mourad Boudjelall has written to Premiership Rugby this week about the prospect. The RFU council would have to approve any change to England's elite competition, and Ritchie believes there are numerous obstacles in Toulon's way. \"I think it's a challenging proposition,\" Ritchie said. \"I would think it's a long shot, but having said that it's for others to discuss as well, and we've not really sat down and had a proper, considered conversation about it yet. \"But in some ways it's interesting Mr Boudjellal thinks that playing rugby in England is good for Toulon, so we should look at that as a positive.\" Despite England's disappointing performance at the World Cup, the RFU says it is on course to meet legacy targets. Early evidence shows participation is increasing, including 8,000 adults returning to the game during and after the tournament, and the RFU has launched programmes to get more schools and clubs playing the sport, and will also provide 100 new artificial pitches across the country. \"We really are trying to use the opportunity the Rugby World Cup gave us to grow the profile of the game - and participation in the game - across the country.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The regime said 22-year-old Otto Warmbier's medical condition was caused last year by botulism and a sleeping pill he was given after his trial. But Fred Warmbier said his son had been treated \"brutally\". He spoke as an Ohio hospital said Otto had suffered a \"severe neurological injury\" and is in a stable condition. \"We went for 15 months without a word from or about Otto,\" Mr Warmbier said of his son, who fought back tears at Thursday's press conference in Cincinnati, Ohio. \"It was only a week ago that the North Korean government now claims that he was in a coma for almost all of that time. \"Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care.\" Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist. Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases. It's caused by the clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves. Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis. That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles. Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds. The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison). This rarely happens in modern western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier. He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. Fred Warmbier told reporters his son had been held as a \"war criminal'. He said he and his wife, Cindy, had relied \"on this false premise that they would treat Otto fairly and let him go\". In honour of his son, Fred Warmbier wore the same jacket Otto was wearing when he was paraded before media to tearfully confess to attempting to take the sign as a \"trophy\" for a US church. Mr Warmbier also appeared to criticise the Obama administration for failing to help secure his son's release. How harsh is prison in North Korea? \"When Otto was first taken we were advised by the past administration to take a low profile while they worked to obtain his release,\" he said. \"We did so without result. Earlier this year Cindy and I decided the time for strategic patience was over.\" The university student was freed hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea, but Fred Warmbier said the professional athlete's visit had nothing to do with his son's release. The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining Americans as political pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme. Pyongyang has accused Washington and South Korea of sending spies to overthrow its regime. Three Americans remain in custody in North Korea. The detentions have come at a time of heightened tension between North Korea and the US and its regional neighbours.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The emotional father of a US student freed by North Korea this week says he does not believe the regime's explanation for his son's coma.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device But the tagline - Alter Your Reality - could easily be used to promote the fight between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather, which will dominate the sporting landscape this weekend. Thus far it has engendered a mix of intrigue and revulsion from observers. Whether you like it or not, this is a sporting event that cannot be ignored. Las Vegas is a city that constantly beguiles visitors into altering their perceptions - and, at times, their common sense - in a haze of hedonistic pleasures. Mayweather v McGregor, with its unabashed glorification of money, image and bravado, fits perfectly within the daily excesses of the world's gambling capital. Saturday's fight will pit a man widely considered one of the greatest exponents of his sport against a mixed martial artist who has never boxed professionally. The outcome should be simple to determine, no matter McGregor's mantra and hubristic claim he is ready to \"shock the world\". But remember this is Vegas. And many believe McGregor's sleight of hand against an ageing Mayweather could provide a major upset. It will be no illusion if he does win, ranking as one of the greatest shocks in sporting history. The debate as to who will triumph will sway back and forth in the coming days - pumped up, no doubt, by yet more hateful invective from the two chief protagonists. The true verdict can only be delivered in the ring, in what is likely to be the richest fight in boxing history. Media playback is not supported on this device Tickets for the venue have not yet sold out - but with an expected five million pay-per-view purchases, the cash will cascade in from those sitting watching at home and at venues around the world. The smell of money permeates the Las Vegas strip at the best of times. This week, the stench is inescapable. Both fighters and their camps have been candid in admitting the contest is all about the cash. However, the language they have used to boost their mega pay day has been disgraceful. A five-city publicity tour in July became a nauseating race to the bottom as each man tried to find fresh insults to hurl at one another. Homophobic put-downs, and racially motivated slurs and stereotypes have soured the build-up to this contest. It was difficult not to wince when McGregor turned to his opponent on the final leg of the tour at Wembley and told him to \"dance for me, boy\". However, both men are equally culpable given their behaviour. Dana White, the UFC president who is representing McGregor, believes it is all justified. \"It's funny when people say they've taken this thing too far,\" he said. \"This is a fight, not a croquet game. This part of the deal; the reality is what's going on here is just as much part of the fight as the fight itself, the mental warfare game.\" It is at this point the true reality of this contest has not been altered but frankly obliterated. Context is everything and this fight is not taking place in a vacuum. The US is scarred and still reeling from recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists marched with burning torches and gave Nazi salutes. It is a country still deeply fractured along racial lines. It is a country where prejudice - and the fight against it in all its forms - is a near constant part of the national conversation. In their own small way, both Mayweather and McGregor, with every hateful word uttered, are expanding the pool of division that already exists in this country. Surely sport should be the place where differences can be set aside? This contest provides an opportunity for examples to be set but it has, so far, been wasted. Trash talk and one-upmanship is one thing. It has always been a part of prize fighting. Language that divides and excludes - that seemingly legitimises homophobic, sexist and racist behaviour - is something else entirely. They certainly aren't the first boxers to trade in such terms. Though both men later apologised, Manny Pacquaio shamefully called people in same-sex marriages \"worse than animals\", while Tyson Fury expressed a Neanderthal view that a woman's best place is \"on her back or in the kitchen\". The truth is boxing offers girls and boys a chance to build self-esteem, to train and dedicate themselves to a higher goal. It provides hope, and often an escape, for many. You just have to listen to Mike Costello and Steve Bunce's recent podcast from the burnt-out Grenfell Tower to see what boxing can do for a community. The building housed a gym with volunteer coaches, all unpaid, giving their time and knowledge to help transform lives. The hope is it can rise again. But some of the most powerful men at the top of the sport have failed time and again to see the gift they possess to inspire and encourage everyone, of all backgrounds, to get involved. Mayweather and McGregor, cosseted in their elite world of Lamborghinis, Louis Vuitton luggage and flashy Las Vegas nightspots, appear to have forgotten this too. Their humble beginnings at gyms in Michigan and Dublin respectively should serve as a reminder of the chances they were provided with. Their respective combat sports have given them untold riches. This week their bank accounts will swell further. With no boxing federation overseeing the bout and the Nevada State Athletic Commission - which sanctioned the fight - refusing to get involved, both Mayweather and McGregor can act however they wish. Even the UFC, in which McGregor made his name, has allowed the Irishman's actions to go unchecked of late. His volatile behaviour before recent events has seen him throw bottles and even try to hurl a chair at an opponent. There is arguably a responsibility for the two most recognisable figures in combat sports to be more guarded with their words and to realise they are custodians; to extol the virtues of the sport that has given them everything. Their most dangerous weapons, it seems, are not their fists but their tongues. No-one expects them to be angels - the true, unaltered reality this week is they have a fight to sell and money to make. And on Saturday a truly intriguing sporting contest will take place. However, the orgy of excess that surrounds it threatens to further sully a sport that right now needs all the help it can get to maintain popularity and relevance. What happens in Vegas should, according to the old saying, stay in Vegas. Hopefully that also applies to the hateful rhetoric of this unavoidable fight.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "At the top of the MGM Grand on the Las Vegas strip is a huge advert for the magician David Copperfield, the hotel's star attraction.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Under the programme, the US allowed criminals to purchase guns in order to trace them to major arms traffickers. But US agents lost track of 1,400 of the firearms, including the ones believed to have killed Terry. A US justice department report has cited 14 people for possible disciplinary action for their roles in the programme. Mr Portillo-Meza was arrested in Mexico in 2012.  He was flown to the US on Tuesday. He has been charged with murder, as well as assault and other charges. \"This development brings us one step closer to achieving justice for a beloved agent who paid the highest price in protecting this country,\" said US Attorney for Southern California Laura Duffy. \"While there is nothing that can be done to bring Agent Terry home again, we hope this news will bring some level of comfort.\" Another man, Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in February for the 2010 murder, which occurred as Osorio-Arellanes and his gang engaged in a firefight with US border agents in rural Arizona. The US justice department announced a $1m (\u00c2\u00a3589,000) reward in 2012 for information leading to the arrest of Mr Portillo-Meza, and three others. Two of the men remain fugitives, while the third is waiting in Mexican custody for extradition. Robert Heyer, Terry's cousin and the family's spokesman, said they were \"thankful that Mexican authorities have continued to work with us\". \"The family has gotten really good at not having high expectations and knowing that things are going to take lots of time,\" Mr Heyer said. \"They have become very patient over the last three-plus years.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The latest threats bring the number of incidents to 69 in 27 states in the past month, according to the JCC Association of North America. No bombs were found at any of the centres targeted with telephone calls. Last week, 27 Jewish community centres in 17 US states reported receiving hoax bomb threats. All of the threats made on Monday, along with previous incidents in January, turned out to be false and Jewish centres have since reopened with normal services resumed. Responding to the latest incidents, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that US President Donald Trump had made it \"abundantly clear\" that such actions were \"unacceptable\". \"Hatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom,\" the statement, which was shared on Twitter by NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander, said. Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka - who has converted to Judaism and whose husband is Jewish - also condemned the threats. Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that action must be taken to prevent further incidents. In a post on Twitter, Mrs Clinton wrote: \"JCC threats, cemetery desecration and online attacks are so troubling and they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/@POTUS.\" The threats were made to the Jewish community centres through calls that were both pre-recorded and live, with suspects using voice-disguising technology, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Since the beginning of the year, there have been reports of threats to centres in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Delaware, Connecticut, Alabama, California, Maine, Tennessee, South Carolina, Missouri, Wisconsin, Texas and Kansas. The JCC Association of North America, a network of health and education centres, has since been reviewing its security plans. In an earlier statement the FBI said that along with the US justice department it was investigating possible civil rights violations in connection with the threats. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish anti-bigotry organisation, said in a statement that it was \"deeply disturbed\" by the latest threats to the Jewish community. Meanwhile, more than 100 headstones have been damaged at a Jewish cemetery in St Louis, Missouri, local media report.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device Then you look at the statistics, and a more complicated picture emerges: a 30-point winning margin but less possession than Italy, less territory, more tackles missed and fewer line breaks made. Nit-picking or nagging doubts? That is the problem with thrilling wins like the one in Cardiff: they inflate expectations, convince the giddy that a team is not just ascendant but untroubled. England started slowly, again, and were once again behind with a quarter of the contest gone. They then took control for half an hour, played with pace and imagination and considerable verve, and were out of sight by the time Italy staged their late and immaterial fight-back. That will be enough for some. In the corresponding fixture two years ago Stuart Lancaster's men were held try-less. In Jonathan Joseph they had not only Saturday's outstanding performer but a young dancer and dasher who is terrifying defenders and delighting supporters every time he is given the ball. Lancaster, for one, wants more. Miss 22 tackles in Dublin on Sunday week and he knows dreams of a Grand Slam will remain exactly that. Give away breakdown penalties to a side with a player who can kick off the tee - Ireland's Johnny Sexton will not be as profligate as Italy 10 Kelly Haimona - and it will be a far steeper road back. For George Ford, man of the match in the Millennium, this was a different sort of challenge in a different sort of match. So far in his nascent Test career the 21-year-old fly-half has had to deal with a disorganised Samoa, an Australian pack going backwards at pace and a giant Welsh back-line determined to dent both his confidence and body. A week ago there was plenty of kicking from hand, a resolve under intense pressure, a premium on his penalty points. On Saturday he could have missed every effort from the Twickenham turf and still seen his side win with something to spare. Instead it was all about the attack - controlling the tempo, choosing his options, freeing the talent outside him. He began well, clearing from his own line off his weaker foot after Ben Youngs' poor pass had cut his time and space. A minute later he was putting a probing kick deep into Italian territory, dabbing another into the 22 only to see it gathered to begin the move that led, 70 metres and two minutes later, to Sergio Parisse's opening try for Italy. Ford, as the win over Wales showed, is not cowed by early disappointment. It was his precision long-range penalty tight to the corner flag that set up England's opening try through Billy Vunipola's line-out drive, his ability to play flat to the gain-line that was creating options for the runners and ball-carriers cantering in support. Not always did he make the right choice. Half an hour in he wasted turnover ball with a poor kick straight down the gullet of his opposite number Haimona. At other times he became a fraction static, passing the ball standing still rather than running at the defensive line to commit and confuse defenders. But in his vision and hands he has what England fans crave from their number 10: creativity, a little conjuring, the quickness of mind and foot to make it count against a well-drilled defence. So it was in the move that led to Joseph's second try. He hung behind his pack, hinting that he might drift down the blind-side, then scything back round to the open spaces on the right after Billy Twelvetrees had come in at first receiver. Twelvetrees timed his pass behind Luther Burrell, and then Ford worked his magic - spotting Anthony Watson drawing one defender wide, faking a quick pass outside to Joseph and then delaying it a fraction as the covering man committed, before popping up a pass for his Bath team-mate to come onto at full pace. After the conversion he was gone, replaced for the final hurrah by another creative mind in Danny Cipriani. But the learning-curve continues, his precocious talents an increasingly pivotal part of Lancaster's plans. His personal stats were solid rather than spectacular: 15 points, just one kick missed from tee from seven, 47 metres made with ball in hand, 31 accurate passes. His kicking style requires a little further fine-tuning, even if he has improved markedly in the last year. There is so much there, and at such a young age, that few doubt that the progression will continue. There is the character, preternatural yet visible from the moment he began playing in England's age-group teams ahead of his time. There are the little details, like the way he manages to almost imperceptibly shift his weight in contact to ride out or roll big tackles. And there is ambition: this is not enough, I must do more. There is also a connection with the key men outside him. Joseph made more metres (123) than any other player, beat five men in seven carries, made two clean breaks. It was Ford's pass that set him away both times. Together with the solidity of England's set-piece, the impact of their replacements and the form in other key positions of Chris Robshaw and Ben Youngs, it means England are aware of two things: they must aspire to better still, but they have the tools to get there.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The firm predicted that the move would help drive the development of autonomous vehicles. Called Apollo, the project will make a range of software, hardware and data services available to others, especially carmakers. Other firms in the sector, such as Tesla and Google, have tended to keep key developments secret. Baidu, often described as China's Google, has been developing self-drive vehicles since 2015. Making the announcement ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show, it said technologies for use in restricted test environments would be available as soon July. There will then be a gradual roll-out of other technology, with an aim to offer its full range of developments to support self-driving for highways and city roads by 2020. In a statement, Baidu's group president Qi Lu said it wanted to create a \"collaborative ecosystem\" using its strengths in artificial intelligence (AI) to \"encourage greater innovation and opportunities, making better use of our technology to drive the evolution of the entire industry\". This move could be likened to Google's decision to release Android, the free operating system for smartphones, says James Chao of IHS Markit. Even though it was free to use, it became a success for Google because it drives users to the company's various mobile apps and services. By becoming the supplier of the \"brains\" for more cars than just the ones it makes itself,  there are clear benefits. One is potential revenue from carmakers in the long term. And what is also crucial to the development of self-driving vehicles is data. The more cars using its technology, the more data it should be able to harvest. \"It really sounds like they want to treat this like a smartphone platform,\" Mr Chao said. \"The holy grail for software in cars is to become the Android or iOS that everyone is using, and this is their strategy to do that.\" Baidu's statement alludes to opportunities in the US, but also in its home market. \"China is the world's largest market for automotive sales and production. It has many car brands and an open environment that is ripe for collaboration,\" group president Qi Lu said. Analyst Mr Chao agrees. \"I can think of at least 20 Chinese carmakers who would be perfect candidates,\" he told the BBC. \"They don't have huge research budgets or the resources to figure out how to make self-driving vehicles themselves. \"These are firms that tend to rely on suppliers so they can build a car and so this fits in perfectly for them.\" He said this could mean that Baidu's technology will be used in millions of cars on China's roads by 2020. However, bigger international carmakers who are already working on autonomous vehicles are unlikely to follow suit. Motivated by the widespread pollution problems, Beijing has pushed for more electric vehicles and Chinese carmakers have responded significantly. And in the race for driverless car technology, Chinese companies are taking big strides. Along with Changan and Geely, Baidu is one of the big players, with AI research being done in both China and Silicon Valley. But it is not clear how the software and hardware Baidu has developed compares with that of its rivals. Some analysts say it has done less testing, and therefore has less data to work with, than Google and Tesla.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Chinese internet giant Baidu has said it will share much of the technology it has created for its self-driving cars.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

If they do, limited services will run on Scotrail, Gatwick and Heathrow Express lines and Southeastern. And there will be no Virgin West Coast mainline services on Monday or Tuesday. The operator, Virgin Trains, also warned that the East Coast line would be badly affected. Widespread cancellations are also expected to be announced on CrossCountry Trains, Chiltern Railways, Arriva Trains Wales and First Great Western on Monday and Tuesday. Rail companies say further disruption and delays are likely on Wednesday, as services return to normal. If the strike goes ahead, fans of Middlesbrough and Norwich City football clubs may have trouble travelling to Wembley for the Championship play-off final at 15:00 BST on Monday. An outline of how the strike will affect all train companies is expected today, with full details likely on Saturday - but passengers are being advised not to travel unless \"absolutely necessary\". Talks between Network Rail and union bosses at the conciliation service, Acas, are continuing. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) have rejected a four-year pay deal of a \u00c2\u00a3500 increase followed by three years of rises in line with RPI inflation. Virgin said if the strike was called off with enough notice, it would hope to run a \"near normal\" service. But Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne has advised travellers not to \"bank on\" the unions calling it off, although he still believes there is \"a settlement to be had\". He said his team would be available all week and into the weekend if necessary, to reach a deal. People who have already booked tickets should check with their train operator on the special measures in place, he added. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said his team were also prepared to continue negotiations over the weekend. \"In the meantime, our picketing arrangements are in place and the response coming back from our members is one of rock-solid support,\" he added. The RMT has been forced into this dispute through \"a wholly-unwarranted attack on safety-critical jobs, pay and working conditions\" that undermines passenger safety, he added. Scottish transport minister Derek Mackay said the strike was \"very likely to go ahead\" and have a \"significant impact\" on rails and roads. ScotRail Alliance managing director Phil Verster, said the firm was \"very disappointed\" to have to make so many cancellations but, as it was a UK-wide national strike, \"there's very little we can do about it from the Scotland side\". He told BBC Radio Scotland 470 Network Rail signallers could strike and he has only 23 contingency signallers so \"our capability to step in is very, very limited\".

The Chilean flag with its white star on a blue background resembles that of the Lone Star state. Tom Oliverson said the resolution was meant to be mainly educational.

Some Texans have developed a habit of using the Chilean flag in text messages and on social media as a sign of national pride. None of the US states currently have their own emoji flag.

Chile and its national symbols have been the subject of mix-ups before.

{"article": "###\nArticle: For the past six weeks or so, he has driven his green Lamborghini to the UFC's new performance institute on a daily basis. At this hub, located about four miles from the city's famous strip, you can mimic conditions at 10,000ft of altitude, clock miles on an underwater treadmill, or analyse the density of specific muscles. If an athlete is to be built rather than born, this is the place. The attention to detail is stunningly intricate and it was Manchester City's own training complex which offered key elements of the blueprint. A group of journalists are led through the $14m development by Forrest Griffin, a retired UFC light-heavyweight champion and now a vice-president with focus on athlete development. He paints details around what we see at the 30,000 square feet facility, which opened in May. Some 23 years have passed since UFC was formed but this building is seen as a game changer which will take the welfare and performance of athletes to new levels. It is far removed from the spit and sawdust gyms which shaped some of boxing's greatest names. Some 24 hours earlier, I visited the Mayweather Boxing Gym, a world-renowned facility which inside is straightforward, humble and brilliantly effective. But the UFC institute cuts with tradition in pursuit of gains. Measurability, science and mapped progress shape the mantra. Griffin explains how recovery is meticulously plotted. He points to one of his own injuries and a subsequent substantial difference in mass between his two quad muscles, detected after his retirement. A UFC fighter at the Institute would be scanned during rehabilitation to highlight which muscles have suffered during their lay-off so targeted rebuilding can be done. Any fighter competing under the UFC banner can train here at no cost. Tailored workout programmes appear on screens next to weight stations. If an athlete is only here for a short spell, their data and subsequent training plan will be sent to an app to use at their traditional base. Whatever the goal - recovery, strength, mobility, technique - there is a desire to offer a menu of ways to work on it. As Griffin stresses, what works for one individual will do nothing for another. In the recovery area, for example, athletes can opt for use of a cryotherapy chamber or laser-light therapy. Both will stimulate circulation, flushing away lactic acid and easing aches and pains. Facilities are purposely placed one room apart to ease access. We pass through a door and Griffin fires up the underwater treadmill McGregor has been filmed using in recent weeks. \"Conor has had a knee injury in the past so he doesn't like to do roadwork,\" says Griffin, 38.  \"So he does a lot of bike work and he uses this as it has no impact on your body and you can work hard.\" Two pools next to the underwater treadmill offer temperatures of 105F and 50F respectively to again offer variety in recovery. Griffin explains why McGregor's typical routine of sleeping in until midday makes perfect sense. \"He's been here once or twice a day for six weeks,\" adds Griffin. \"Training at the time you fight is under appreciated. When do you work out the best, after being up for 12 hours or three or four hours? He primes his body to do that, which is intelligent.\" We are taken to meet UFC flyweight Joe Benevidez, who is receiving treatment from director of physical therapy Heather Linden. Linden left a role at the USA's Olympic Training Centre in Colorado Springs to be here. She jokes when explaining how even the toughest UFC fighters can struggle on a pilates ball when she isolates their weakest muscles in order to highlight where work is needed. \"What's been a shock is how little access to services these athletes have had in the past,\" she says. \"It's amazing how some of them have never had medical guidance for preventative measures. \"I've had to build trust.

He was scared of telling people in the event he was pulled from competing but with work we restored him to full functionality in two weeks.\" Former UFC welterweight Dan Hardy is part of the tour. The Nottingham-born 35-year-old describes the facilities as \"night and day\" to what he used. \"My life would be different now,\" he tells the group. \"I used to work with friends for treatment, driving around for different things I needed.\" Despite all the technology in what feels like the slickest of finishing schools, MMA critics still exist. Perhaps blighted by images of the ground and pound or blood-stained faces they question the morality of the sport. But UFC's growth shows no sign of relenting. The company was sold for $4.2bn in 2016 and listening to Griffin it is obvious this is a sport with vision. Mapping the layout of the Institute saw the UFC research facilities at the likes of Man City, the Phoenix Suns basketball team and the USA Olympic team base. Habits were observed, such as an athlete's occasional tendency to neglect post-workout nutrition if access to it was not made easy. Consequently, UFC athletes can only exit the building by passing a nutritional team. \"We learned from mistakes people had made in the past,\" adds Griffin. \"A facility and its staff may be too spread out. Manchester City have a great layout. The locker room is the centre of the building. The athletes start and end in the locker room so you build every service around that. \"Every sport taxes the human body a certain way. The needs and demands change but the impact on the body and the recovery needed is very similar.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Elsewhere on the ground floor we see anti-gravity treadmills which take away impact, a 50m outdoor track and walls with numbered targets for medicine balls to be thrown at.

Her friend Kyle Pirrie has started a petition seeking to see the medicine Vimizim made available on the NHS. There is no known cure to Morquio syndrome but the drug improves the life of people with the condition. It replaces a missing enzyme which allows children to continue to grow, as well as improving stamina and the ability to walk. It also relieves pain. The drug's manufacturers have been providing the treatment to patients at their own expense but they are going to withdraw it unless the NHS in England and Scotland commit to funding it. The Stranraer Academy student said her life would be markedly different without the drug. \"I wouldn't be able to move I'd just be in so much pain,\" she said. \"And I probably wouldn't be able to go to school.\" It was that situation which prompted her friend to launch the petition which now has nearly 2,000 signatures. \"As a friend I suppose I felt kind of bad that she was going to be denied this because I know she has got a great outlook on life,\" Kyle explained. \"She's funny, she's friendly and I would hate to see her in pain all the time.\" Galloway and West Dumfries MSP Alex Fergusson has also backed the petition. \"This is not a cheap medication but, as Katie herself asked me, how do you put a value on a human life?\" he asked. \"There are only just over a hundred sufferers throughout the UK, with just five in Scotland, and those who have had treatment with Vimizim report a massive reduction in pain and the other symptoms of this syndrome. \"Life expectancy, which rarely exceeds the mid 20s without treatment, can be considerably extended with this treatment, and it is enormously to the credit of Katie and her friends that they have raised this petition to try to ensure that the treatment is available to all.\" The Scottish Medicines Consortium said the drug was currently going through its assessment process.

When asked if she hoped for a rethink, Williams said: \"We deserve it.\" Speaking to BBC Midlands Today, Williams continued: \"What we, as a club, have worked so hard to do for 25 years is to get to the required standard - which we meet.\" Women's Super Rugby, into which there will be a multi-million pound investment by the RFU over the first three years, is aimed at improved playing standards and increasing participation in the game.

Media playback is not supported on this device Ashworth added: \"Those players are established internationals. It's like being a first-team player and asking them to come back and play in the U21s. It's not necessarily the right thing to do. \"The players who hadn't competed in the two-year cycle and lead-up to the European Championship wouldn't be considered. \"The debate will be reopened now but we stand by the decision Gareth and I made. You never know when you drop players into a new group whether it'll be the right thing to do.\" England, who had Premier League quality in Tottenham striker Harry Kane, Everton defender John Stones and new Liverpool forward Danny Ings, lost 1-0 to Portugal, beat Sweden by the same score but then lost 3-1 to Italy. Ashworth had a key role in the FA introducing proposals - the 'England DNA programme' - in December aimed at improving England's prospects at major tournaments. The plan is to co-ordinate the style, formation and tactics from the under-15 side upwards. And he believes improvements can be seen already. \"I don't want to hide behind the fact we're devastated to have been eliminated in the group stages,\" Ashworth said. \"We're disappointed with the group that we hoped and thought might go a bit further. But there are some success stories. \"In order to win things at senior level, we need to develop players who can deal with the ball in all areas of the pitch. We have to prioritise that in the development teams. \"They're young players and they'll make mistakes - it will cost us games. We have to accept that. We can't after six months say that's wrong, let's just crash it down the other end as quickly as we can. \"We're starting to see a different kind of player come through the system now.

We have the pathways getting better at clubs and international level. \"We've introduced an Under-15s, 18s and 20s in the past 12 months because we recognise we need to give our players more big-game experience. \"You've seen at this tournament we need players who are able to make decisions at the top level in the big games in order to win tournaments. But that takes time - it doesn't happen overnight. \"We're all doing the right things but we need to sit tight and be a little patient and let it run its course. I'm convinced it will.\" Match of the Day pundit Gary Lineker criticised the \"exasperatingly amateurish approach\" not to select players such as Sterling, Wilshere and Barkley for the tournament. \"We never learn. What a wasted opportunity to gather invaluable international experience,\" the former England captain added on his Twitter page. Former QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who won one cap for England, said the \"culture is rotten\" in English football, and criticised the power of the Premier League clubs. \"There doesn't seem to be the pride there once was at representing England at any level or a major tournament,\" he told BBC 5 live. \"We have a talent pool to match any nation. It's not the players or coaching staff. It's not one thing, it's an accumulation of many things. \"The culture in English football isn't changing. No St George's Park, no massive spend, no changing coach will change it. The culture is rotten from top to bottom. The England national team will underperform at every single tournament for this reason. \"The players think 'I'm too good for the under-21s, I've been in a senior squad - I don't want to go to a major tournament. I need to rest because I want to play in the Europa League or Champions League next year'. \"Or 'hang on it's better for my career not to go to this tournament'. Or their managers are saying it. That's the problem with the Premier League being stronger than the FA. It's impossible for England to build good teams. \"The FA should say to them if you don't make yourself eligible for the under-21s, then you won't be considered for the national team for however many years. \"I feel for Dan Ashworth, I feel sorry for Gareth Southgate, I feel sorry for Roy Hodgson. What they are trying to do is so difficult until they get the Premier League back in line.\" Former England defender Danny Mills has been on an FA commission set up to assess potential improvements to English football. He said it could take a decade for major improvements to come to fruition, and also suggested English players earning too much is to blame. \"We looked at this as a commission and decided things needed to change. Gareth has only been in the job two years. Things don't change overnight. Changing the way England play and players develop will take 10 years at least. That's what the Germans had to do before becoming very successful. \"Do they get too much too soon? It's very difficult for the coaching staff. Raheem Sterling doesn't want to play for Liverpool - he certainly would have caused more problems for the under-21s than he would have done them good. \"When me and Joey were coming through, playing for the under-21s and national team was massive kudos. \"That doesn't happen now, they're given so much so early in club football that England Under-21s has become secondary.

{"article": "###\nArticle: But there is a mismatch between those soothing words and the aggressive trade policies laid out during the campaign - which included harsh tariffs on China and tearing up existing agreements. It is hard to know if Mr Trump will follow up on his threats, but they have a combustive potential. And trade is one area where the president has freedom to act without the approval of lawmakers in Congress. Five questions on economy for Trump UK businesses react to Trump's win Trump's economic promises President Trump: All hat, now where are the cattle? So what did we learn during the campaign about Mr Trump's views on trade? Well, you can find a summary of his policies on his campaign website, but here's a quick tour. Perhaps his most radical idea is to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese-made goods, if China does not reform its trade relations with the US. Mr Trump has floated the idea of a swingeing 45% tariff on Chinese imports. In a big economic policy speech in June he told workers at a metal processing plant that China had \"cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficit and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property\". During that speech he reminded workers that President Reagan had imposed tariffs of 45% on Japanese motorcycles and 100% on computer chips. If Mr Trump's threat crystallised it would supply a shock to the US economy as China is an important supplier of many goods. Take mobile devices for example. China supplies three-quarters of the phones imported into the US and it supplies almost all laptop and tablet computers. Mr Trump has also been scathing about the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Introduced in 1994 it greatly reduced, and in some cases eliminated altogether, tariffs for trade between the US and its two immediate neighbours, Mexico and Canada. \"Nafta was the worst trade deal in the history of this country,\" Mr Trump said in June. He blames the deal for the loss of thousands of US manufacturing jobs and wants to reverse that by renegotiating the terms of the deal. If Mexico and Canada do not agree to the new terms, Mr Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement altogether. In February, after five years of work, the US and 11 other nations signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the biggest multinational trade deals ever. That agreement now looks dead as Mr Trump has called it a \"horrible deal\" and said that he would block it. The deal involves 12 nations from around the Pacific Rim, and was partly designed to counter the growing economic power of China. However, Mr Trump claims that trade with those nations had already cost the US two million jobs - with the manufacturing of cars and car parts particularly suffering. A lot of work has also gone into a new trade deal between the US and the European Union. Since 2013 the two sides have been negotiating the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP, aimed at removing or reducing trade barriers. That deal has faced opposition in Europe and now, with a US administration that is sceptical over trade deals, looks even less likely to reach fruition. An existing deal under threat is the 2011 free trade agreement with South Korea. According to figures quoted on Mr Trump's campaign website, the deal has cost 100,000 jobs and has not resulted in any increase in US exports to South Korea. While many nations might have their trade deals torn up, the UK might well be looked on favourably by the Trump administration. The president-elect was a supporter of the UK leaving the European Union and last month his trade adviser Dan DiMicco told the BBC that negotiating a new trade deal with the UK would be \"one of the first things\" that his trade officials would do. Mr DiMicco also said that Mr Trump was serious about his threats over trade: \"Things have gotten so bad that we will leave Nafta, WTO [the World Trade Organization] and the Korean Free Trade Agreement if we can't get a fair deal. \"These are not idle threats.\" But the WTO has congratulated Mr Trump on his victory and appeared to acknowledge his concerns over jobs. The WTO is \"ready to support the administration to ensure trade is a positive element in a new strategy for development & job creation,\" tweeted director-general Roberto Azevedo. \"It's clear many feel trade isn't working for them. We must address this and ensure trade delivers the widest benefit to the most people,\" he added.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "At his victory rally in New York US president-elect Donald Trump promised \"great, great relationships\" with other nations.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The government investigation said the bodies were burned at a rubbish dump hours after the students went missing. But the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights says it has found no evidence to support claims that the bodies were incinerated. The Mexican government is sending forensic experts to the area. The move was announced by Attorney General Arely Gomez Shortly after the IACHR report was published. Relatives have always rejected the official investigation. They accused the authorities of covering up the alleged involvement of high-ranking officials and possibly the army in the killings. The case shocked Mexico and led to weeks of protests against official impunity and the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto. Analysis: By Katy Watson, BBC News, Mexico City This report confirms what many people have believed for a long time - that the government's investigation into the disappearance of the 43 students was deeply flawed. The families of the missing disagreed from the start with the government's version of events - now they've been vindicated. There is a lot that is still unknown - the report doesn't explain what happened to the students and only suggests possible motives. But what is clear is that the government needs to step up its efforts to get to the bottom of what actually happened.  President Enrique Pena Nieto has been hugely criticised for his handling of this case - this report will heap yet more pressure on him. After a six-month investigation, the Washington-based IACHR released a report of nearly 500 pages urging the government to continue looking for the missing students. A Peruvian fire expert hired by the commission concluded that it was impossible for all the bodies to have been burned at the landfill site in the municipality of Cocula, in the western state of Guerrero. Jose Torero, from the University of Queensland in Australia, said it would have required 13 tonnes of tyres, 20 tonnes of wood and 13 tonnes of diesel to cremate the bodies. It would have taken the gang 60 hours to finish the job, he said. \"There is no evidence indicating the presence of a fire of the size [needed] for the cremation of even one body,\" Mr Torero concluded.

They are reported to have disrupted a rally planned by the mayor's wife later in the evening. They were then allegedly handed over to the local Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) criminal gang, which was told to kill them and dispose of their bodies. Several people were arrested in the following days, including the mayor, his wife, local policemen and men accused of belonging to the local gang. The government said some of the people who took part in the killings led them to the landfill site. According to the original inquiry, forensic experts managed to retrieve there a fragment of a bone, which was identified as that of one of the missing students after DNA tests in Austria.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "An independent investigation into the disappearance of 43 Mexican students nearly a year ago has rejected the government's account of events.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) was launched in 2007, and is mainly comprised of troops from Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya and Ethiopia. In South Sudan, conflict between government and rebel forces has seen more than 2.2 million people flee from their homes in the state, which broke away from Sudan in 2011. The British troops being sent to South Sudan will also carry out engineering work to strengthen infrastructure. It follows a commitment by UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the UN in New York in September. It formed part of a pledge in the Strategic Defence and Security Review to double the number of UK troops on UN \"blue-hatted\" peacekeeping tasks and support efforts to end some of the world's most destabilising conflicts. Speaking at the time, Mr Cameron said operations \"will help to alleviate serious humanitarian and security issues... helping to bring stability to the region and preventing these challenges from spreading further afield\". Announcing the arrival of the team in Somalia, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: \"This deployment is another demonstration of the flexibility and global reach of our armed forces.\" It showed the UK's \"determination to tackle terrorism wherever it rears its head\", he added. The Ministry of Defence said the UK military's contribution to UN peacekeeping reflects a long history of supporting the organisation, including a lasting presence in Cyprus.

{"article": "###\nArticle: The data, published in the Lancet, shows that only one in 200 women - or 0.5% - is still doing any degree of breastfeeding after a year. That compares with 23% in Germany, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal. The researchers said it was a \"widespread misconception\" that breastfeeding was beneficial only in poor countries. In the UK, 81% of mothers had tried breastfeeding at some point, but only 34% were breastfeeding at six months and 0.5% at 12 months. In the US, 79% started, 49% were still going after six months and 27% after a year. It is the worst record in the world. Breastfeeding is far more common in developing countries, but the UK figures are behind even similar countries in Europe. Women in the UK are advised to feed their baby exclusively on breast milk for the first six months and then a combination of breast milk and other foods, however, it does not give a recommend end-point. Breastfeeding is good for the health of the baby and lowers the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Prof Cesar Victora, report author from the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, said: \"There is a widespread misconception that the benefits of breastfeeding only relate to poor countries. \"Nothing could be further from the truth, our work clearly shows that breastfeeding saves lives and money in all countries, rich and poor alike.\" The Lancet report said breastfeeding in developed countries reduced the risk of sudden infant deaths by more than a third. And in poorer countries, half of cases of diarrhoea and a third of respiratory infections could be avoided by breastfeeding. Overall, the report's authors said that near-universal breastfeeding could save over 800,000 children's lives a year. A commentary, signed by Save the Children UK and the World Health Organization, was critical of formula milk being promoted at the expense of breastfeeding. It said: \"The active and aggressive promotion of breast milk substitutes by their manufacturers and distributors continues to be a substantial global barrier to breastfeeding. \"Promotion and marketing have turned infant formula, which should be seen as a specialised food that is vitally important for those babies who cannot be breastfed, into a normal food for any infant.\" Commenting on the findings, Sarah Redshaw, from the BabyCentre website, said: \"It is crucial to bear in mind the various barriers and challenges faced by mums when it comes to breastfeeding. \"Generally mums are aware that breastfeeding is best for their baby but often don't get the right support if they encounter problems in the early weeks - which many, many do. \"As a result, significant numbers give up on breastfeeding.\" Follow James on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Rates of breastfeeding in the UK are the lowest in the world, an international study shows.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The Duke of York was named in US court papers relating to the handling of a case against financier Jeffrey Epstein. In the palace's second statement on the claims, it said those made about the duke were \"without any foundation\". The Mail on Sunday has named the woman as Virginia Roberts. The BBC has not been able to verify her identity. Palace officials made a second statement after further details about the allegations were published in Sunday newspapers. An initial statement had said \"any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors\" by the duke was \"categorically untrue\". BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt described the latest palace denial as \"quite remarkable\". He said it was understood Prince Andrew was now back in the UK after a skiing holiday in Switzerland, and it was likely his first public appearance would be at a reception at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, later this month. This situation \"has the potential to seriously damage Prince Andrew and the institution he represents,\" our correspondent added. The woman behind the allegations says she was forced to sleep with the prince when she was under age, and on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein - between 1999 and 2002. A US lawyer, meanwhile, says he is planning legal action against the woman. Alan Dershowitz, who was also named in the court documents, told the BBC he wanted her claims to be made under oath. Mr Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said: \"My goal is to bring charges against the client and require her to speak in court. If she believes she has been hurt by me and Prince Andrew, she should be suing us for damages. \"I welcome that lawsuit. I welcome any opportunity that would put her under oath and require her to state under oath these false allegations.\" Mr Dershowitz also said he thought Prince Andrew should take \"whatever legal action is available\" to clear his name. He added: \"You cannot allow these false allegations simply to remain out there, and you cannot allow people who make false allegations to have the freedom to continue to make them.\" He previously told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the allegations against Prince Andrew must be presumed to be false, and that he had only met the prince at public occasions. The woman has issued a statement through her lawyers, saying she was \"looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse\", adding that she was \"not going to be bullied back into silence\". The court document alleges that Epstein sexually trafficked the woman making her available for sex to \"politically connected and financially powerful people\". Prince Andrew and Mr Dershowitz are two of three well-known men named in the court document who it alleges had sexual relations with the woman. The prince, who is fifth in line to the throne, has previously been criticised for his former friendship with Epstein, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for soliciting a minor for prostitution. The prince and Epstein were photographed meeting in December 2010, after the tycoon had served his prison sentence, and the prince has also visited Epstein at his Florida home over the years. The prince later had to apologise for his friendship and stepped down as the UK special representative for trade and investment. US citizen Virginia Roberts waived her anonymity in an interview with the Mail on Sunday in 2011, claiming she had been sexually exploited by Epstein as a teenager. She also claimed to have met Prince Andrew on several occasions, but the paper said there was no suggestion of any sexual contact between Virginia Roberts and the prince.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Buckingham Palace has \"emphatically denied\" Prince Andrew had sexual contact with a woman who claims she was forced to have sex with him under age.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

They were inside the trailer without access to air conditioning or water while outside temperatures hit 38C (100F). Police say they believe the incident is linked to people smuggling. Video footage from the store reportedly showed a number of vehicles arriving to pick up some of the survivors. Several others may have managed to escape on foot into the woods nearby. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting head Thomas Homan said more than 100 people could have been in the truck at one point. Mexico's government said it was working closely with US authorities to identify the nationalities of the victims. San Antonio is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico, and the US immigration department is trying to establish the victims' legal status. Officials were brought to the trailer by a man who had approached an employee of the Walmart store and asked for water. San Antonio police chief William McManus said in a press briefing that the people ranged from school age to in their 30s. Local fire chief Charles Hood said the survivors had heart rates of over 130 beats per minute and were very hot to touch. The fire chief confirmed at least two of the victims were school-age children. Their condition is not clear. The US attorney for the Western District of Texas, Richard Durbin, said the people were helpless victims of \"ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo\". Experts say people smuggling is a serious issue in southern Texas, and there have been a number of similar cases in the area just in this past month. On 7 July, US Border Patrol agents found 72 undocumented immigrants from Central American countries locked inside a trailer \"with no means of escape\". The next day 33 people were found locked inside a trailer at a checkpoint on the road to San Antonio.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A truck driver has been charged with illegally transporting immigrants after dozens of people were discovered in the back of his trailer.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: For just over a year when I was 14 years old, I suffered from anorexia nervosa. Weighing a tiny amount, I bought children's clothing and consumed fewer than 500 calories a day. Anorexia nervosa is far from just a battle of wills to resist eating a chocolate bar. It's a serious mental illness. A possession. As though developing a split personality\u200a-yourself and the anorexia. In fact, that's exactly what happened to me. Prior to the illness, I'd been a happy girl and enjoyed a great relationship with my parents, but that deteriorated when anorexia embedded itself in my head. I developed techniques and deceptive ways to make it look like I'd eaten when I hadn't. I'd dispose of food in literally any way I could. I became sneaky and desperate, and I'd lie constantly, dreading any time away from school because home-time meant food time. 'I've eaten' techniques included sprinkling toaster crumbs on a plate to make it look like I'd had toast. I'd hide any food down sleeves, in pockets, in bras, in my cheeks, anything to avoid swallowing it. I'd mop up milk from my cereal with tissues. For a girl who loathed maths more than she currently hated life, I became highly adept at calorie calculation. For a girl who loathed maths more than she currently hated life, I became highly adept at calorie calculation. And I knew how much EVERYTHING provided me with. My mum was immediately on my tail when I started to get thin. I'd exercise compulsively\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally anything to burn calories. I'd relish any chance to get away from my parents so that I could burn calories exercising. I remember running laps of the playground during Girl Guide hours in the evening because it was the only time I could run and burn calories. My patrol must have thought I was very strange. Now that I was below a healthy weight, my periods had stopped and I was attending weekly appointments at the Youth Hospital seeing a dietician and a psychologist. I was clinically depressed and spent every day being force-fed by my parents while I screamed and cried like a banshee at the threat of being fed two spoonfuls of ice cream. I could see my thighs were bigger in the mirror after eating anything calorific. That delusion to me was as real as the glass itself. The body dysmorphia was terrible. I could see my thighs were bigger in the mirror after eating anything calorific. That delusion to me was as real as the glass itself. I believe that I still suffer from this dysmorphia a little even now, over ten years later and at a much healthier weight. My recovery was largely down to my mum, whose persistence in monitoring my every move eventually forced the voice in my head to say 'I can't win this', and slowly begin to shrink back. I remember that moment vividly as though the anorexia actually admitted defeat and resigned. To this day, I can see a girl in the gym and know that she's struggling. I think it's in the arms. There's one at my gym right now. I see her working her tiny limbs like a demon on the spin bike, only she barely has any real muscle to power herself. The fight to create a more versatile fashion and beauty industry is still one which is continuing relentlessly today. ALL healthy bodies are beautiful in any shape, any size and any form. It's not about banishing sample sizes from the runways, TV and magazines, it's about creating body diversity. Young girls need to see models walk down the catwalk with healthy bodies resembling that of the average woman. They shouldn't have to be labelled as 'plus size', because they're not. They're just women. Note: BodyPositive has removed some of the more sensitive aspects of this story.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Shadow culture secretary Maria Eagle called the rumoured plans \"unacceptable interference\". A BBC source said it would be odd to make it harder for people to watch programmes they had paid for. The government denied it intended to determine the scheduling of programmes. Details are expected in this month's White Paper on BBC Charter renewal. 'External regulation' A number of Sunday newspapers carry reports suggesting the BBC will be called upon to defend its scheduling where rivals are unfavourably impacted. A government source told the Sunday Times the White Paper was intended to \"set a broad set of principles and guidelines\". \"How that is applied to individual programmes and scheduling is a matter for them. But they will be subject to external regulation.\" It could see the BBC forced to move popular shows such as Strictly Come Dancing, or the recent BBC One hit The Night Manager, from peak-time slots on a Saturday or Sunday night - ending the traditional ratings wars. In the past ITV has criticised the BBC for \"aggressive scheduling\" citing, among others, the conflict between The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing. Mr Whittingdale has previously expressed concerns about the BBC's flagship News at Ten bulletin being broadcast at the same time as ITV's. Ms Eagle said:  \"John Whittingdale is behaving as if he were running the BBC - he is not. \"This kind of meddling in day-to-day scheduling decisions would be a completely unacceptable interference in the independence of the BBC. \"The public will wonder why the government is interfering with the BBC, and why they are trying to dictate when they can schedule hugely popular programmes like Strictly Come Dancing.\" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said no final decisions had been taken, but added: \"The Secretary of State has made it clear on a number of occasions that the government cannot, and indeed should not, determine either the content or scheduling of programmes.\" Media commentator Steve Hewlett said he thought there would be something in the charter \"more general\" about the BBC's approach to its impact. \"In other words, increasing the BBC's sensitivity to its impact on commercial competitors. \"Not just in TV and radio but also online and amongst the newspaper publishers. \"I'd be very, very surprised if there is a specific injunction not to schedule any particular programme anywhere because it's far too detailed, it's exactly what the government or the regulators shouldn't be doing.\" The BBC source denied \"aggressively scheduling\" but added: \"We do show programmes at the times people want to watch them\". \"Research has shown that an element of competition drives up quality across the industry and the public would be deeply concerned if the BBC's ability to show programmes such as Strictly, Doctor Who, and Sherlock, at the times convenient to them were taken away. \"It would be odd to make it harder for people to find and watch the programmes they have already paid for.\" A recent independent report into the BBC, commissioned by the government, researched the impact of scheduling similar shows at the same time. The report, published in February, concluded the impact was \"not statistically significant\", calculating a dip of no more than 1% in viewing figures, irrespective of whether it was a drama or a light entertainment show.

{"article": "###\nArticle: Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November. It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat. The comet has since moved nearer to the Sun and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos. An account linked to the probe tweeted the message, \"Hello Earth! Can you hear me?\" On its blog, Esa said Philae had contacted Earth, via Rosetta, for 85 seconds on Saturday in the first contact since going into hibernation in November. \"Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,\" said Philae project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. Scientists say they now waiting for the next contact. Esa's senior scientific advisor, Prof Mark McCaughrean, told the BBC: \"It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment.\" Philae was carrying large amounts of data that scientists hoped to download once it made contact again, he said. \"I think we're optimistic now that it's awake that we'll have several months of scientific data to pore over,\" he added. This is one of the most astonishing moments in space exploration and the grins on the faces of the scientists and engineers are totally justified, says BBC science editor David Shukman. For the first time, we will have a hitchhiker riding on a comet and describing what happens to a comet as it heats up on its journey through space, he adds. Philae is designed to analyse the ice and rocky fragments that make up the comet. Prof Monica Grady from the Open University told the BBC that scientists now hoped to be able to carry out experiments to see whether comets were the source of life on Earth. Comets contained a lot of water and carbon, and \"these are the same sorts of molecules responsible for getting life going,\" she said. \"What we're trying to find out is whether the building blocks of life, in terms of water and carbon-bearing molecules, were actually delivered to Earth from comets.\" When Philae first sent back images of its landing location, researchers could see it was in a dark ditch. The Sun was obscured by a high wall, limiting the amount of light that could reach the robot's solar panels. Scientists knew they only had a limited amount of time - about 60 hours - to gather data before the robot's battery ran flat. But the calculations also indicated that Philae's mission might not be over for good when the juice did eventually run dry. The comet is currently moving in towards the Sun, and the intensity of light falling on Philae, engineers suggested, could be sufficient in time to re-boot the machine. And so it has proved. Scientists must now hope they can get enough power into Philae to carry out a full range of experiments. One ambition not fulfilled before the robot went to sleep was to try to drill into the comet, to examine its chemical make-up. One attempt was made last year, and it failed. A second attempt will now become a priority. Return of the plucky robot Philae's extraordinary opportunity Rosetta: The whole story The Rosetta probe took 10 years to reach 67P, and the lander - about the size of a washing-machine - bounced at least a kilometre when it touched down. Before it lost power, Philae sent back images of its surroundings that showed it was in a dark location with high walls blocking sunlight from reaching its solar panels. Its exact location on the duck-shaped comet has since been a mystery. Esa had a good idea of where it was likely to be, down to a few tens of metres, but could not get Rosetta close enough to the comet to acquire conclusive pictures. Continued radio contact should now allow precise coordinates to be determined, correspondents say. Comet 67P is currently 205 million km (127 million miles) from the Sun, and getting closer. It is due in August to get as close as 186 million km, before then sweeping back out into the outer Solar System. As it nears the sun, the comet will warm and its ices will melt. This process will throw out a huge shroud of gas and dust, and if Philae can continue to keep working it will provide scientists with an extraordinary view of what is happening right at the surface of 67P.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The European Space Agency (Esa) says its comet lander, Philae, has woken up and contacted Earth.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The crisis was sparked by the murder of an ex-IRA man and the Ulster Unionists' subsequent exit from the executive. Arlene Foster said the DUP was prepared to take \"our own action\" if the government did not intervene. \"We will be taking unilateral action next Monday,\" the finance minister said. \"We will give them space the rest of this week to come forward with their own solution, but if nothing happens between now and next week we will be taking our own action.\" The assembly is due to return from its summer recess next Monday, and Mrs Foster said it would \"certainly be very different\" after a turbulent month in Northern Ireland politics. After meeting with Secretary of State Theresa Villiers on Wednesday, Sinn F\u00e9in's Alex Maskey said the party again made clear its opposition to any assembly suspension. \"Martin McGuinness made it very clear to the secretary of state that any suggestion that the  British government should suspend these institutions, Sinn F\u00e9in will be very, very hostile to that,\" he said. \"Further to that we will not be in any way cooperating with the concept of self-suspension. \"We believe that people out there want all the parties to ensure that these institutions succeed and more importantly that they deliver for the communities.\" Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said it was up to the Northern Ireland parties to sort out the crisis. \"I believe we can sort it out if there's political will and we certainly have the will to sort this out, because we don't want to collapse anything, we want to fix everything,\" he said. In August, police said they believed Provisional IRA members were involved in the murder of Mr McGuigan Sr. Chief Constable George Hamilton said the paramilitary organisation still has structures in place at a senior level but added there was no evidence that hierarchy had sanctioned the killing. That was rejected by Sinn F\u00e9in - it said the IRA had left the stage after ordering an end to its armed campaign in 2005. But the UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said Sinn F\u00e9in's denial that the IRA existed made it \"impossible to do business with them\" and has left the executive.

Catches of saithe, whiting and herring will be decreased in line with long-term management plans.

The increase will give UK fishermen an additional 542 tonnes and Scottish fishermen around 343 tonnes. A 6% increase in the haddock catch to 40,711 tonnes gives the UK an additional 3,468 tonnes and Scottish fishermen more than 2,500 extra tonnes. Scottish Fisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead said: \"I am pleased there has been an increase in the quota of these key stocks for next year which is in line with the recent scientific advice that the stocks are in good shape. \"It is welcome the agreement has been reached quickly this year compared to the protracted talks last year and will provide certainty for the industry about opportunities in 2015 and avoids any delays to the commencement of fishing in the new year. \"There is much to be done to prepare for the discard ban which starts to come into force for white fish from 2016.

{"article": "###\nArticle: However, once it had served its usefulness, two-thirds of it was given an unceremonious burial beneath the city's post-war buildings and the new A474 road up the Tawe valley. Now - thanks to a dedicated band of enthusiasts - a small but vital section is to be put back to water. When it was formed in 1981, the Swansea Canal Society managed to save the last remaining five miles (8km) between Clydach and Ynysmeudwy. In recent years, more than 25,000 hours of volunteer work has seen lock chambers re-pointed, eroded banks repaired, and new steps and walls built at both Clydach Lock and Lower Trebanos Lock. In the latest stage of the project, Swansea council has donated part of a former transport depot off Pontardawe Road in Clydach, which was built over the canal and lock number seven. When reinstated, this 300ft (90m) stretch will link two sections of the canal already in water. But, as Martin Davies of the Swansea Canal Society explains, the entire project was greatly helped by the extraordinary farsightedness of a council engineer, back in 1973. \"The society had talked for years about trying to excavate the section of the canal which runs through pipes beneath the transport depot, but we had no way of knowing what remained of the lock, and therefore whether there'd be any point,\" he said. \"Then a few years ago John Evans, the man who built the depot in 1973 made contact with us. \"He said that even then he'd envisaged a time when people would want to save our industrial heritage, so before burying it under concrete, he'd re-pointed and reinforced lock number seven, and had only to remove the top five feet of the lock chamber to level it off. \"It's incredible. Without his imagination it would have been lost forever; so it's fitting that his son has gone on to be waterways manager on the Kennet and Avon Canal.\" In its heyday the Swansea canal was a feat of 18th Century engineering; with 36 locks and five aqueducts carrying the water from 365ft (111m) at Abercraf, to where it reached sea-level at North Dock. For a century and a half it carried around 400,000 tonnes of coal, iron and steel each year to feed the Industrial Revolution. Indeed, several towns and villages such as Ystradgynlais, Ystalyfera and Clydach owe their very existence to its success. But by the turn of the 20th Century it was feeling the pinch from the competition of railways, and the last commercial barge to travel the canal was in 1931. \"So much of our history came down that canal, from the copper works of Swansea, to the iron of the valleys, The Mond Nickel Works, and what was at the time the biggest tinplate works in the world at Pontardawe,\" said Mr Davies. \"After its closure in 1931 it was briefly used during World War Two, but after that it was gradually covered over. \"Back then there was no interest in preservation. There's even a piece of 1960s BBC news footage, talking about what a fetid eyesore it was, and how it needed to be built-over as soon as possible.\" Whilst the reopening of lock number seven is still some years off, demolishing some of the transport depot and reinstating the towpath to extend Sustrans National Cycle Route 43 could be achieved relatively quickly. Attention will then turn to dredging the navigable section of silt, with a view to holding a trail boat festival there in 2019. Mr Davies now believes that the time has come where public thinking has turned full-circle away from burying our past. \"With the success of projects like the extension of the Liverpool-Leeds canal, authorities are recognising that for every \u00a31 they spend on restoration, they can make back \u00a37 in tourism,\" he said. \"If we can get the Swansea canal to reach the Fendrod River, onto the Tawe, and back to the docks, from there it would only take a short section of new canal to meet up with the Neath and Tennant Canals. \"That would give us a U-shaped 35-mile (56km) stretch which would take around three days to cruise, and how much tourist revenue could that raise?\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Constructed between 1794 and 1798, the Swansea canal once ran for more than 16 miles between Swansea and Abercraf, and was the artery which created the Swansea valley as we know it.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: They will be able to end tenancies, sometimes without a court order, when asylum requests fail, ministers say. Landlords will also be required to check a migrant's status in advance of agreeing a lease. Repeat offenders could face up to five years in prison. But critics have said it may lead to UK citizens being refused accommodation. The proposals - to be included in the upcoming Immigration Bill - come as the British and French governments struggle to deal with a migrant crisis in Calais, where large numbers of people are making nightly bids to cross the Channel to reach the UK. Under the proposals for landlords in England, the Home Office would issue a notice when an asylum application fails that confirms the tenant no longer has the right to rent property. Analysis by legal correspondent Clive Coleman It is currently a criminal offence to remove tenants without a court order. Obtaining that order enables bailiffs to evict tenants. That all takes time. The new measure may cut out court orders, but it is unclear: This will trigger a power for landlords to end the tenancy, without a court order in some circumstances. Landlords will also be required to carry out \"right to rent\" checks on each tenant's immigration status before allowing them to move in, expanding a pilot that has been running for a year in the west Midlands. Repeatedly failing to do either would be a new offence carrying maximum penalties of five years' imprisonment or a fine. A blacklist of \"rogue\" landlords and letting agents will allow councils to keep track of those who have been convicted of housing offences and ban them from renting out properties if they are repeat offenders. Communities Secretary Greg Clark acknowledged that cases in which tenants refused to move out would still end up in court but that the process would be quicker because landlords would have official \"evidence\" to present to the courts of their tenant's status. \"You have saved the landlord having to spend money establishing something that is clear and that the Home Office can provide - which is a clear statement of whether they should be there or not,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Asked whether evicting migrants simply increased the risk of people disappearing altogether, unless immediately detained by the police, Mr Clark said the initiative was part of a \"joined-up system to send people home\". Analysis, by Alicia McCarthy The streets of the UK are not paved with gold. That's the clear message the government wants to send to those tempted to come to Britain illegally. Ministers say the tightening of the demands on private landlords in England is simply the enactment of a manifesto promise to make them carry out the same checks as employers and that migrants need to know there is no right to work or rent a home if you are in the UK illegally. It's not clear yet how the scheme will work or what impact it will have other than moving illegal immigrants from where they are living. And some may suspect the timing of the announcement is a response to the nightly television news pictures showing scores of desperate migrants trying to cross the channel - and to criticism from some that ministers have failed to get a grip on the situation swiftly enough. For Labour, shadow immigration minister David Hanson said he backed tougher checks but said ministers appeared to be \"offloading\" the problem on to landlords and it was up to the authorities to decide whether people should be allowed to remain or deported. Since August 2014, private landlords in five councils - Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Birmingham - have been required to conduct checks to establish new tenants have the right to rent in the UK or face face a penalty of up to \u00a33,000. Mr Clark said the pilot - introduced as part of the 2014 Immigration Act - had been a success and would be extended across more of the UK, although he could not say how many people had been deported as a direct result. But the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said the pilot - which has yet to be officially evaluated - had serious shortcomings. \"We have heard that British people with foreign accents are finding it difficult to get tenancies from some of the, you might say, unscrupulous landlords,\" its chief executive Habib Rahman told Radio 4's World at One. And David Smith, from the Residential Landlords Association, said there was evidence of \"document discrimination\" with some landlords reluctant to rent their properties to anyone who could not produce a valid passport.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Landlords in England will be expected to evict tenants who lose the right to live in the UK  under new measures to clamp down on illegal immigration.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: The 21st Century successors to the Red Guards are not a physical presence. After the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and the tragedy of the Beijing massacre in 1989, young people are not allowed to demonstrate in China. But some now hound their enemies online. The underlying rage is reminiscent. The instinct for intimidation is the same. Despite all its strengths and all its engagement with the world, China is once again prey to political groupthink and fear. The latest trigger is a speech by a Chinese student at an American campus. On 21 May, at an official event, Shuping Yang praised the fresh air and freedom of speech she had found at the University of Maryland. The video clip of her speech quickly went viral and triggered an outpouring of anger from fellow Chinese students in the US and critics at home. Shuping Yang swiftly apologised, asked forgiveness and said she had no intention to belittle her country. But that was not enough to stop the flood of \"I am proud of China\" posts accusing her of lies and deception, or the online \"human flesh searches\" to dig up incriminating information about her and her family. Of course there are good reasons to be proud of China and every Chinese citizen is entitled to list them. In the past week alone, China has sent a submersible deep into the Mariana Trench and its world champion go player Ke Jie took on the AlphaGo AI computer programme and almost beat it. Every day ordinary Chinese people display the energy, talent and hard work of which their fellow citizens should be proud. But being proud of China does not mean denying another Chinese citizen the right to an opinion. In fact, Shuping Yang herself said she too was proud in her message of apology. The irony is that the very backlash against her has only served to make her point about the want of freedom of speech in her homeland. It has also highlighted a conflict between a commitment to free speech in Western countries that host large communities of Chinese students and the growing determination of the Chinese government and some of its citizens that free speech should be limited when it comes to talking about China, even beyond Chinese borders. Freedom of speech is any society's feedback loop. It means precisely the freedom to say what is different or what may even offend. Of course, different societies have a different view on how much of this is appropriate. But if China's freedom of speech goes no further than parroting the leader and attacking those who dare to speak from a different script, then its spirit is lurking in the shadow of the Mao era. Which brings us to Chairman Xi and his style of leadership. In English Xi Jinping is usually referred to as President Xi. But his power comes from being leader of the Communist Party and since taking up that role five years ago, he has collapsed the distinction between party and government and dramatically shrunk the space for freedom of speech. All public debate, whether in the media, academia, the legal profession or online, is a shadow of what it was in 2012. It is now off-limits to discuss universal values or liberal democracy.  Instead China must loudly unite around the leadership of the Communist Party and \"tell China's story confidently\". Confidence is understandable. In Xi Jinping's first five-year term, China has become the world's second-largest economy and an increasingly powerful military power. But when Chairman Xi urges journalists, think-tanks and diplomats to \"tell China's story confidently\" he does not mean tell it how you like and with your own nuance. Students abroad are a particularly important voice in this chorus. It is stated Chinese government policy to \"assemble the broad numbers of students abroad as a positive patriotic energy\". And so when the University of California San Diego announced that it would host a speech by Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama next month, the local Chinese Students and Scholars Association consulted with diplomats and threatened \"tough measures to resolutely resist the school's unreasonable behaviour\". At Durham University in the UK, the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, again with the support of the Chinese embassy, attempted to bar from a debate a critic of China's religious policies and human rights record. This week's mobilisation against Shuping Yang, complete with commentaries in leading state media, is part of this drive for \"positive patriotic energy\". All of which causes some bafflement on the campuses concerned. Students from countries with a tradition of free speech may feel irritation with someone who criticises their homeland in a public speech, but their instinct is usually to shrug it off or make a joke. Likewise when Chinese state media deploy students from Western countries praising China and its policies, such individuals do not become hate figures for outraged student associations or national newspapers. That's because liberal societies take differences of opinion for granted. In the US, in Europe and in Australia, citizens regularly excoriate their own governments and praise other countries in the media, and on satirical TV and radio shows. They also mount protests against their leaders. It is vital to Beijing that these habits should not rub off. So in Chairman Xi's era the numbers of Chinese students studying abroad is going up but their tolerance of diverging views on China is going down. In one respect, this is puzzling. At great expense, young Chinese have chosen to move from the confines of China's tightly-controlled education system to the \"fresh air\" of campuses which cherish tolerance and which offer all the tools to explore a range of different narratives of their own place in the world through reading and debate. But it is not so puzzling if you factor in these students' prior ideological education, the pressure on them to perform academically, and the ever-present and watchful eye of the Chinese state. Tension is likely to grow between the liberal values of Western campuses and the \"positive patriotic energy\" of the growing numbers of Chinese students on these campuses. But the very strength of the reaction to Shuping Yang's freedom speech ensures that her words will continue to echo. After all, it's not just Western culture which honours a loyal opposition. It is firmly entrenched in the historical memory of China too. Respect resonates down through the centuries for officials and soldiers in the imperial and the more recent Communist era who braved banishment or death for daring to speak truth to power. So be #proudofChina by all means, but don't go back to the frenzy of the Red Guard era, and remember that in all great civilisations, the patriots whose memories endure are often those who love their country enough to point out its flaws.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Half a century ago millions of Chairman Mao's Red Guards gathered in rallies in Tiananmen Square to chant slogans and wave their red books of his quotations in a show of loyalty to the ideas of the \"Great Helmsman\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The eggs command a high price from farms which produce meat, leather and other goods, so there are plenty of people willing to take on the risky job. But whether this derring-do should be legal or not has become a hot topic in the state of Queensland, where the government is reviewing its crocodile management plan. Proponents say legalisation in the neighbouring Northern Territory brought substantial economic benefits, particularly to indigenous communities, without affecting crocodile numbers. Critics, though, say it is not right to take the eggs, as most are already lost to inundation or predation. Leichhardt Federal MP and former crocodile farmer Warren Entsch says few people understand the crocodile industry and \"it's easy to bring emotional claptrap\". He told the BBC he strongly supports legalising egg harvesting in Queensland. He would like to see a quota of eggs taken from nests, harvested, then sold to farmers who supply skins to global fashion houses. Mr Entsch said the number of saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory had grown substantially despite the provision for egg harvesting, with current estimates putting their population at around 100,000. \"Now there are more crocodiles [in the Northern Territory] than before when the 'white fella' came to Australia,\" said Mr Entsch. \"The proliferation of the crocodile is huge and that in itself is causing a few problems.\" But conservationists say only a few crocodiles reach maturity in the wild and removing eggs could have a devastating impact. \"We're playing God to a degree, there's a reason why their [survival rates] are so low, because only the strongest fittest baby will survive,\" Australia Zoo crocodile research team leader Toby Millyard said. The wild world of crocodile farming Warren Entsch said one of the more unusual encounters he had while crocodile farming was during a flight over Queensland in the 1980s. He was forced by the pilot to travel in the cargo bay alongside a bigger-than-expected haul of crocodiles. Three were tied up and covered with hessian bags because Mr Entsch miscalculated the number of transportation cages. He told the BBC he was given a loaded handgun and warned not to shoot the fuel tank if the crocodiles escaped their makeshift restraints. The animals became ill due to altitude sickness, leading them to vomit and defecate throughout the plane. \"They went ballistic,\" Mr Entsch recalled. Crocodile farmer John Lever, from Koorana in Queensland, has been on multiple trips to gather eggs from crocodile nests. The 63-year-old said he had some close calls with crocodiles, but \"it's a bit like having a near miss in your car, you go off and forget about it\". \"You learn to manage behaviour about the nest, but when a big male challenges you at night and you're on a little boat on the river in the dark that can be pretty intimidating when they're 5m (16ft) and three quarters of a tonne (750kg),\" Mr Lever said. The estuarine crocodile is protected as a vulnerable species under current Queensland legislation, a point of conjecture on both sides of the debate. The state government says it will only back the egg harvesting plan if it does not threaten the animal's survival in the wild. Mr Millyard said accurate surveys of crocodile populations had not been conducted for a decade and needed to be completed before a decision was made. \"Anything people say about crocodile numbers is really hearsay and opinion,\" he said. The final report into a trial live egg collection trial in Cape York - the largest and most intact tropical savanna left on Earth - is expected to be released by the Queensland Government in the coming weeks. Robbie Morris, environmental manager of Pormpuraaw Aboriginal Shire Council in Cape York, said the study has shown there would be no impact on populations if a limited harvest of wild eggs are taken from nests that would already be washed away by flooding. \"Wild eggs could be taken and hatchlings reared without influencing the population,\" he told the Cairns Post. \"If we do actually get the go ahead to do a wild egg harvest there would be scope for three or four permanent positions at the farm for local indigenous people.\" The Australian Conservation Foundation's Andrew Picone said a range of issues needed to be considered before allowing egg harvesting in Cape York. \"At face value it presents some problems [but] if there's not any economic opportunities on the Cape [York] things like mining and other extractive industries will continue to be seen as the only option, and undermine tourism,\" Mr Picone told the BBC. He agreed that expanding the farming industry in Queensland could also provide culturally appropriate opportunities for remote indigenous communities. Meanwhile, the Northern Territory recently increased the number of eggs that can be harvested each year by 40% to 90,000 viable eggs. Its Wildlife Trade Management Plan also allows for the take of 1,000 live crocodiles. The government aims to double its crocodile products industry to A$50m ($35m; \u00c2\u00a324m) in four years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "It is the stuff of Boys' Own adventure novels - rugged Australians dropping into wild saltwater crocodile nests to snatch day-old eggs from territorial females.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Thirty Palestinians have been reported killed on Sunday and militants have continued to fire rockets into Israel. The Foreign Office confirmed that Mr Hammond had spoken to the Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman and Israeli justice minister Tzipi Livni on the telephone on Sunday. During that call Mr Hammond said he reiterated the UK's \"need for an immediate and unconditional humanitarian ceasefire\". He said: \"I welcome indications that Israeli forces may begin to withdraw from Gaza within the next few days.\" Mr Hammond also told the Sunday Telegraph the crisis in Gaza could become \"an endless loop of violence\". \"The British public has a strong sense that the situation of the civilian population in Gaza is simply intolerable and must be addressed - and we agree with them.\" In a strongly worded statement on Saturday, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had previously been \"right to say that Hamas is an appalling terrorist organisation\". \"Its wholly unjustified rocket attacks on Israeli citizens, as well as building of tunnels for terrorist purposes, show the organisation's murderous intent and practice towards Israel and its citizens,\" he said. \"But the prime minister is wrong not to have opposed Israel's incursion into Gaza and his silence on the killing of hundreds of innocent Palestinian civilians caused by Israel's military action will be inexplicable to people across Britain and internationally.\" On Sunday Mr Miliband reiterated that criticism, telling the BBC the government needed to send \"a much clearer message to Israel that its actions in Gaza are unacceptable and unjustifiable\". \"What I want to hear from David Cameron is that he believes Israel's actions are wrong and unjustified and we haven't heard that from him.\" He said rocket attacks on Israel by Palestinian militants \"cannot excuse the scale of the loss of life of innocent Palestinian civilians including children that we are seeing\".

{"article": "###\nArticle: The proposals, by Leighton Andrews, to bring back bigger councils are broadly similar to pre-1996 arrangements. Mr Andrews called the case for fewer local authorities \"compelling\". However, the plans have been criticised by the body representing local authorities, some Labour council leaders and an ex-Labour minister. Mr Andrews's blueprint envisages the return of historical counties such as Dyfed and West Glamorgan. Dyfed would be brought back by re-merging Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, and West Glamorgan would return by joining Swansea once more with Neath Port Talbot. Cardiff would merge with the Vale of Glamorgan, while a merger between Caerphilly, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent, Newport and Monmouthshire would create Wales' biggest council, with a population of nearly 600,000. Bridgend would join Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr Tydfil. The minister will consult further on whether to move to two or three councils in north Wales. In the eight-council model, Anglesey, Gwynedd and Conwy would merge, as would Denbighshire, Wrexham and Flintshire. The alternative would see Conwy and Denbighshire merging. The cross-party Williams Commission advised against an eight-council structure, in January 2014, warning many gains from mergers would be \"jeopardised or lost\". The report stated: \"Such proposals would mean creating local authority areas like the whole of Gwent or the whole of north Wales.  It would be very difficult to meet multiple diverse local needs effectively, or to maintain fair democratic representation within such areas.\" Mr Andrews has dropped plans to place \"term-limits\" on councillors, whereby an individual would only be able to serve for 25 years. He is also proposing the current cap of 75 members per council be raised to a higher level. In a written statement, Mr Andrews added: \"I want to emphasise this is not a final decision. It is the next phase in discussions.\" A draft bill will be published in the autumn but no changes will be made before next spring's assembly election. Mr Andrews is confident his plans are on the right side of the political argument, despite criticism from senior Labour council figures. He told BBC Wales: \"Welsh Labour will be happy to go into the election next year campaigning to reduce the cost of politics and administration in local government.\" But the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) dismissed the proposals, saying there was \"no political consensus\" on the future shape of councils, either across political parties in the assembly or between Welsh ministers and local authorities. The WLGA called for an  \"urgent summit\" of council leaders and the Welsh government. Association leader Bob Wellington, also the Labour leader of Torfaen council, said: \"This summit could debate the way forward in terms of structures, but more importantly set in place a new vision for local government which is currently at the epicentre of public sector funding cuts and is having to carry a disproportionate share of the huge austerity burden.\" There was fierce criticism of Blaenau Gwent's proposed merger with Caerphilly, Newport, Monmouthshire and Torfaen from its local Labour AM, a former environment minister. Alun Davies said such changes would \"only distract from the important issue of focusing on the challenges facing us as a borough\". Urging Welsh ministers to \"listen and to reach out with meaningful discussions\", he added: \"Simply issuing diktats is the worst way to promote debate and discussion.\" Dominic MacAskill, from public services union Unison, said it would be \"demanding that staff, our members, are put at the heart of considerations and that Welsh government commits to providing adequate funding for the transition costs of any restructuring\". Mr Andrew's proposals came under immediate fire from assembly opposition parties. Conservative shadow local government minister Janet Finch-Saunders condemned what she called an \"uninspiring map\" chosen to \"best serve the tribal party political interests of the Labour Party instead of ensuring proper local representation for families across Wales or delivering efficient local services\". Plaid Cymru's Rhodri Glyn Thomas welcomed the fact the Welsh government had \"made clear its preferred map\", but criticised the plans for not integrating health and social care. Liberal Democrat AM Peter Black said \"shoving together existing councils in a botched party-political stitch-up serves no-one aside from the Labour party\". * There could be further consultation on merging Conwy and Denbighshire to create an additional council in north Wales. COUNCIL LEADERS' REACTION Blaenau Gwent: Labour leader Hedley McCarthy said it appeared \"we are to be the periphery of a new mega-council which will be distant and remote from the people it is supposed to serve\". Denbighshire: Independent council leader Hugh Evans said the authority was \"unclear about what, if any, review has led to the current proposed map\". But he said a possible consultation on combining Denbighshire with Conwy, rather than with Flintshire and Wrexham, deserved \"serious consideration\". Gwynedd: Dyfed Edwards, a Plaid Cymru councillor, told BBC Radio Wales: \"I do think in the north, dividing along north east and north west is right. I think two authorities is enough for the north.\" Monmouthshire: Conservative Peter Fox accepted the need for some reform but expressed disappointment. He said: \"We're back to the future it looks like. I believe in local identity and local decision making, I believe that's really important to people.\" Pembrokeshire: Independent council leader Jamie Adams said he was worried about the \"obvious loss of local decision-making and accountability\" and the \"real damage reorganisation could do to a very successful brand\". \"I am referring to the Pembrokeshire name, which is instantly recognisable to those living far outside our county and even beyond Wales,\" he said. Rhondda Cynon Taf: Labour council leader Andrew Morgan said: \"All council leaders will now need to consider the detail of the Welsh government's proposed map; I personally will want to remain focused on protecting the interests of services we provide to the communities we represent currently and the staff we employ to deliver them.\" Swansea: Labour council leader Rob Stewart said he did not think the planned merger with Neath Port Talbot held \"any fear\" for the two authorities. He said: \"We already work as a city region. Swansea is undoubtedly the capital of that region but it doesn't mean people in other parts of the region should worry.\" Vale of Glamorgan: Labour council leader Neil Moore said a plan for a voluntary merger involving his authority and Bridgend was turned down in January because it would cross a local health board boundary. He called it \"bizarre\" and \"galling\" for Mr Andrews to now want Bridgend to join Merthyr and Rhondda Cynon Taf across another local health board boundary. ANALYSIS BY VAUGHAN RODERICK The third shake up in Welsh local government in 40 years would see the return of some familiar borders and names, the new all-purpose authorities roughly matching the eight counties which formed the upper tier of Welsh councils until 1996. While some will welcome the return of historical names like Gwent and Dyfed - others would mourn the passing of the equally historic names like Pembrokeshire and Monmouthshire. While sentiment may fire opposition to the changes in some areas, other will claim that the new authorities could prove remote and that any change would be a distraction at a time when local government is under severe financial pressure. Meanwhile the issue is likely to figure heavily in next year's assembly election, with all three opposition parties opposing the government's map.

He said the inquiry was \"yet another process\" rather than progress towards helping people. Mr Findlay told BBC Scotland's Timeline programme how he had spoken publically before about what happened to him, but has not been contacted about giving evidence to the inquiry. He was abused by one of his teachers, who is no longer alive, at Aberlour House, a prep school for Gordonstoun private school in Moray which Mr Findlay went on to attend.

I was convinced by him that I imagined it, that nothing happened.\" Mr Findlay said what happened to him as a child \"tainted\" his adult life, including work and personal relationships. On the inquiry, he said: \"I would love to say I have hope, however, it is yet another announcement of yet another inquiry and yet another process. \"I see actually no progression whatsoever with regards to any government or any school providing genuine help for victims of abuse. \"It is all very well saying 'yeah, we are looking into it', but for crying out loud it is about time you could just turn around and say instead of spending how ever much on inquiries why not just spend the money on helping the victims of this abuse.\" Gordonstoun is among boarding schools and other institutions involved in the investigation.

A spokesperson said: \"It will focus on the systemic institutional failures which saw many of our most vulnerable children, including those in the care of the state, abused by the very individuals who were there to care for them. \"We want that inquiry to be able to undertake its work in a timescale that can address the issues raised by survivors. \"Scotland is one of the few countries in the world that has dedicated funding for support services for adult survivors of child abuse. \"We have made real progress in delivering what survivors told us they wanted, including a greatly expanded support fund of \u00c2\u00a313.5m over five years to co-ordinate access to and deliver resources, integrated care and support for those who were abused in care.\" The spokesperson said Deputy First Minister John Swinney had also committed to a consultation on redress, pledging to work with survivors to consider the wide range of differing views on the subject.

The Night Wolves' vice-president, Felix Chernyakhovsky, has insisted the bikers still intend to make the trip. \"Everything remains the same. We're starting tomorrow as planned,\" he told Interfax news agency. The Night Wolves are subject to US sanctions for alleged active involvement in Crimea and for helping to recruit separatist fighters for Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. Russia's foreign ministry said it was \"outraged\" at Poland's decision. The Night Wolves' planned road trip through Poland stirred such controversy because of the group's close association with Vladimir Putin and its support of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. They are viewed in Poland as the \"Kremlin's Hells Angels\". The day after news of the trip appeared earlier this month many Polish newspapers illustrated the story with a photograph showing a sunglass-wearing, helmetless Russian president riding an enormous three-wheeled Harley-Davidson Lehman Trike with the club in Crimea in 2010.

The page's co-host Jarek Podworski, a biker from Krakow, told me the Night Wolves were not motorcycle enthusiasts but criminals, some of whom had taken part in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Besides, he added, Poles remembered the Soviet occupation of Poland. Warsaw has been a strong critic of Moscow's actions in Ukraine. The Polish foreign ministry said three other Russian biker groups would be allowed into the country. But it said it was notified of the group's plans only on Monday, and without details of the route or number of participants. The ministry added that it had informed the Russian embassy in Warsaw that the lack of information meant \"it could not ensure proper security for the participants\". However, Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement: \"It is clear that the decision that was taken has a political motive.\" The Night Wolves intend to cross several countries, following a path taken by the Red Army in World War Two, with the aim of arriving in Berlin in time for 9 May Victory Day celebrations in Moscow.

Economic growth in the March quarter of 2014 was 2.9%. \"The March quarter GDP [gross domestic product] growth was far better than feared just a few days ago,\" said Mr Oliver, who is chief economist with AMP Capital in Sydney. \"However, Australia is still not out of the woods, as annual growth at 2.3% is well below potential, and a full 0.8% percentage points of the 0.9% growth came from higher inventories and trade.\" He said domestic demand remained \"very weak with consumer spending and home construction only just offsetting the ongoing slump in mining investment\". \"So the Australian economy has not crashed - as many had feared would happen after the end of the mining boom - but it is continuing to grow at a sub par pace,\" he added. Australia's economy has been adjusting to a post mining-boom landscape. It saw its economy grow 0.5% in the October to December 2014 period from the quarter before, when growth was 0.4%. On Tuesday, the country's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), did not cut its lending rates further to help boost the economy, despite pressure from businesses to do so. The decision saw Australian stocks fall 1.72% as investors saw little hope of a further cut in the near future. However, Evan Lucas from IG Markets in Melbourne said \"the collapse of [Australian stocks] on the back of the RBA not having an explicit easing bias... was a bit of an overreaction\". In May, the RBA cut its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to an all-time low of 2%. Rising property prices in Australia's biggest city, Sydney, a strong currency and a drop in iron ore prices were among the reasons for the cut. The May rate cut was the second this year, following a previous 25 basis point cut in February and followed similar action from central banks in China, Canada, Singapore, Korea and India. A rising Australian dollar had also been cause for concern, particularly for Australia's big mining and energy exporters. Mr Oliver said more help would likely to be required \"in the form of an even lower Australian dollar - and to ensure this happens the RBA may yet still have to cut interest rates further into record low territory.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Australia's economy grew at a better-than-expected 0.9% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the previous quarter, boosted by mining together with financial and insurance services.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: But the summer visitor is in decline and, according to a new study, its migratory habits may be to blame. Scientists have tagged birds leaving the UK and believe they take two different routes on their journey to spend the winter in Africa. Surprisingly, survival is lower on the shorter route via Spain, they report in the journal, Nature Communications. And this suggests that migration - as well as other factors such as loss of farmland and insect food - may be to blame for the cuckoo's decline. More than half of cuckoos in the UK have been lost over the past 20 years, according to the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) in Norfolk, which led the research. \"That pattern of starting in the same place but taking two very different routes to get there has not been seen before in any birds, to the best of our knowledge,\" said lead researcher Dr Chris Hewson. \"We need to understand the full annual cycle of a migratory bird in order to understand its population decline.\" Facts about the common cuckoo Source: British Library/RSPB/BTO Since 2011, the BTO has been satellite-tracking cuckoos to study their migration patterns when they leave the UK. Working with the University of Copenhagen, the charitable research institute used satellite tags to track 42 male common cuckoos from the UK population during more than 50 autumn migrations. The researchers found that birds from declining populations were more likely to migrate to winter breeding grounds in central Africa along a western route (through Spain) than along an eastern route (via Italy and the Balkans). The higher mortality occurred before reaching the harsh environment of the Sahara desert, despite the fact that the western route is about a tenth shorter at this point. The scientists think birds may have encountered challenging drought conditions in Spain. Alternatively, they may have been deprived of insect food such as hairy caterpillars before leaving the UK, leaving them with lower fat stores for their hazardous journey. Migratory bird species are increasingly threatened around the world due to factors including climate change, habitat change and habitat loss. Migratory birds 'lack world protection' Understanding where mortality occurs during their annual cycles is therefore increasingly important, especially for long-distance migratory land birds, which show some of the steepest population declines, say the scientists.

He added: \"I want to thank all the teams that showed interest. It flatters me incredibly and pushed me to be strong.\" Force India are currently fourth in the constructors' standings. The team had always insisted they had Perez under contract for 2017 but it took some time to finalise commercial arrangements with the driver and the group of Mexican companies that sponsor both him and the team. Perez's career was hanging by a thread when he was dropped by McLaren after one season with them in 2013 but since joining Force India he has scored four podium finishes to add to the three he achieved with Sauber in 2012. In the process, he has emerged in the last couple of seasons as one of the better-regarded drivers behind the big names in the leading teams and has more than justified his place at the pinnacle of the sport, despite the fact he brings money to a team to secure his place. Both Williams and, particularly, Renault were interested in him, but he has decided that Force India is his best competitive opportunity. The team have one of the smaller budgets in F1 but have impressed in recent years for their ability to produce a competitive car. If they can maintain fourth position this season under pressure from Williams, it would be their best finish since the team were in their original guise as Jordan, who peaked with third place in 1999. Perez's decision leaves only a few loose ends to be tied up in the 2017 F1 driver market. Williams are expected to announce shortly that they are promoting Canadian novice Lance Stroll, who on Sunday won the European Formula 3 championship, to partner their current driver Valtteri Bottas. Brazilian Felipe Massa announced last month that he was retiring at the end of the season, which would leave Renault as the only major team not to have firmed up their drivers. Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari are all retaining the same line-ups as this year and McLaren are promoting their reserve driver in Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne to partner two-time champion Fernando Alonso in 2017. Alonso's current team-mate Jenson Button has decided not to race next year. The team have an option to bring him back in 2018 if they want to, but the 2009 champion said at the Malaysian Grand Prix this weekend that it was \"quite possible\" he would not race in F1 again. Renault have long been expected to promote their French reserve driver Esteban Ocon into one of their cars next season, with both current drivers Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer under pressure for their seats. But Renault have not yet made their decision and are taking their time. The lack of availability of other drivers means either Magnussen or Palmer may be retained, although that is not believed to be Renault's first choice.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Mexican Sergio Perez is to continue with Force India for a fourth successive season in 2017.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: Kensington and Chelsea Council won an earlier case against Sophie Sotello in the magistrates' court after she refused to comply with the order. When she appealed against the decision, the council dropped its case. It said that it was now satisfied with evidence showing that her son, 11-year-old Gabriel Sotello, was receiving a suitable education. Gabriel Sotello is one of more than 21,000 children on local council records as being home schooled. According to the home education group Ed Yourself numbers have grown rapidly - by 17% between July 2013 and July 2014. Many of these pupils, like Gabriel, have never been to school. Others have been taken out because their parents felt they were being bullied, neglected or were not reaching their potential. Home schooled children do not have to follow the national curriculum or take part in public exams such as GCSEs or A-levels. Mrs Sotello says her role is not to teach Gabriel, but to point him in the right direction. \"I wouldn't dream of saying I teach him,\" she says. \"I facilitate, I find the books, I research with them, I give them the power if you like.  It is child centred, finding out what makes them tick.\" Gabriel initiates much of his own learning and says he is inspired by the freedom to focus on what most interests him. \"Freedom is what makes learning still fun,\" he says. \"In home education you can learn at your own pace and you do learn much quicker.\" Parents give various reasons for shunning school, and taking direct responsibility for educating their children. Jackie Fahy, who organises a weekly meeting in a London park for like-minded parents, says some doubt the worth of the regimented school curriculum. \"A lot of children come out of school not prepared. The workplace is changing so rapidly that actually the school system is huge and vast and slow to change.  I'm not sure that children will be prepared for having several careers in a lifetime.\" Elizabeth Lil - who opted to educate her son and daughter herself - says that as a former teacher she felt that barely a tenth of her time in school was actually benefiting children. \"I was a science teacher, I did maths. I've so far used trigonometry once in my adult life. What you learn at school is not necessarily the skills you need for your adult life.\" These parents complain that councils are exceeding their powers by carrying out routine inspections of the quality of their children's education. They insist that councils should intervene only if they have evidence that something is wrong. But grey areas persist over exactly what councils can or should do. Government guidance is clear that local authorities have no statutory duty to investigate the education children are receiving at home on a routine basis. It says that parents are not legally obliged to cooperate with requests from councils for information. The guidance tells councils not to confuse home education with truancy. But it acknowledges that if councils are concerned then they might impose the sort of school attendance order sent to the Sotellos. In a statement, Kensington and Chelsea Council acknowledged the right of parents to educate their children at home. But it said \"when this happens we believe that we have a duty of care to establish that the child is receiving a suitable education\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A London council has withdrawn an order forcing a mother to send her home educated child to school.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The findings, reported in the journal Science, could lead to cheaper and greener cars, planes and electronics. It is the first time that durable \"thermoset\" plastic has been produced in a recyclable form. Dr Jeanette Garcia, from IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, stumbled upon the first new class of thermosets in many years when she accidentally left one of three components out of a reaction. \"I had this chunk of plastic, and I had to figure out what it was,\" Dr Garcia told the BBC. \"I had to smash my round-bottomed flask with a hammer.\" That chunk of plastic, produced from unexpectedly simple ingredients, proved to be tremendously hard and stable. Crucially, it could be digested in acid, reverting to its original components. This digestion reaction allows the chemical building blocks, or monomers, to be reused. \"It was definitely fortuitous,\" Dr Garcia said. \"The first thing I did, of course, was to hit the literature, to try and see if it'd been done before. I just assumed that it had been - it's such a simple reaction.\" But her search turned up nothing. This was new. Once she understood what she had created, Dr Garcia set about repeating her finding. \"We wasted a lot of flasks,\" she said. Because they are strong and light-weight, thermosets are used throughout modern cars and aircraft, often mixed with carbon fibres to form composites. Some 50% of the new Airbus A350 jet, for example, will be made from composites. Yet until now, none of this thermoset plastic could be recycled. \"The potential impact here is phenomenal,\" said Dr Charl Faul, a materials chemist at the University of Bristol. He says the study offers a \"very simple, elegant answer to a very old problem\". Dr James Hedrick, who was in charge of the research at IBM, is excited by the possiblities. When a large or expensive component is damaged or reaches the end of its useful life, he explained, it could be repaired or recycled instead of thrown away. \"The ability to rework saves a tremendous amount of money and mitigates waste.\" Beyond replacing thermoset-based composites in current technology, Dr Hedrick sees the potential for many more innovative applications. \"We're at the discovery phase,\" he said. \"Every time you discover a new polymer-forming reaction it leads to all sorts of new materials.\" As well as very hard and durable plastics, the researchers adapted their procedure to a different monomer and produced flexible, self-healing gels. These could be useful in anything from cosmetics, to paint, to the design of drug capsules, because of their particular solubility properties. \"Applications are running like water,\" Dr Hedrick said. \"We don't even know where to go with this yet.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Researchers have developed a collection of new plastics that are recyclable and adaptable - and the discovery began with a laboratory mistake.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: He says small companies are not receiving the funding required to grow. \"We have been appallingly bad at giving those minnows the long-term capital they need,\" said Mr Woodford. On the BBC, Tech Talent coverage is asking whether the UK can compete in the global tech industry. The UK is a magnet for entrepreneurs - around a third of them come from abroad. But according to Mr Woodford and others, home-grown tech entrepreneurs are not turning promising starts into leading global companies. Rory Cellan-Jones: Has the UK got Tech Talent? Mapping the UK's digital clusters On Monday, the BBC will look at the vibrant and growing UK tech scene and ask why it has failed to find a Google or Facebook. A variety of reasons have been put forward, including a digital skills shortage, a lack of leadership experience and difficulties in raising finance. Rohan Silva, a tech entrepreneur and former adviser to David Cameron when he was prime minister, says funding for start-ups has \"long been seen as a big problem in the UK\". \"There's two types of funding,\" he told the BBC. \"There's the funding that comes from friends, family and fools: the start-up money - \u00a350,000, \u00a3100,000 - to get going. There we've really made a big difference in the UK. We've created the world's most generous tax breaks for that kind of investment.\" The second type is \"scale-up cash\" to help companies grow, which is still proving \"a big challenge\". \"There is a big role for government in providing a bunch of that funding, particularly when it comes to research in the laboratory and helping that go to market,\" he says. Mr Woodford agrees that financing is a major constraint. \"We have four of the top 10 universities in the world, 29 of the top 200. We do science and research really, really well in the UK and we're generating lots of little companies,\" Mr Woodford said. According to him, it is after this stage that the problems emerge. Mr Woodford argues that UK investors are too short-term and do not have the scale to support small technology firms. Hussein Kanji, co-founder of Hoxton Ventures, agrees: \"It would still be hard for something like an Uber to be born out of the UK because I don't think there's a financing community that would give Uber the billions of dollars that it has consumed to get to global stage.\" Others point out that Silicon Valley has had longer to perfect the process. Eileen Burbidge has worked at Apple and Yahoo and is now a venture capitalist based in London. \"They [Silicon Valley] did have an ecosystem that was cultivated in the 1940s and 1950s frankly by the US government and the defence industry that were originally in that part of California.\" One problem, Mr Silva says, is the UK's entrepreneur relief which gives a lower capital gains tax when businessmen and women sell their company. \"The problem is this relief perversely encourages you to sell out early. If you did decide to try and build a Google or an Uber in this country, you'd actually pay a much higher tax rate than if you'd sold out and decided to live in a country mansion after a few years.\" Mr Woodford also believes that UK entrepreneurs have been too quick to sell out once the business gets going. But this is not a path that Taavet Hinrikus, chief executive and co-founder of London based peer-to-peer money transfer service TransferWise, is intending to follow. His company has become what is known as a unicorn - a company set up since 2000 which is now valued at more than $1bn (\u00a3770 mn). There are fewer than 20 in the UK. He said he would not sell-up at the moment. \"We're just getting started with the company so why should we stop now? What would I do? I'd go on the beach for a day and then I would become incredibly bored and I would have the same urge to change the world for the better. I think starting over would be going backwards,\" Mr Hinrikus said. Another theory is that universities aren't being supportive enough. \"We haven't been as opportunistic, adventurous and entrepreneurial as others,\" said Annalisa Jenkins, boss of Dimension Therapeutics, a gene therapy innovator. \"In the past academics have traditionally viewed success, quite rightly, as their ability to publish their research in leading journals... the notion of turning their inventions into innovations that really drive value for people hasn't really been rewarded and recognised in terms of the culture of our country in the last 20 to 30 years,\" Ms Jenkins said.

So how much damage has the fire done to the city's architectural landscape? Maria Erskine, curator of community history for Nottingham City Museums and Galleries describes the site as \"significant\" in terms of the social and economic history of the city.

It was used by the lace-making industry before cigarette production began there in 1903. Players' Victorian factories featured high ceilings and large windows. Many of the company's original buildings were demolished when the larger Horizon factory was built to meet the firm's production needs in Lenton in the 1970s. \"Players relocated because they couldn't build anymore in Radford as there was so much housing and that's why there's been a slow erosion of these buildings. \"The firm's advertising later took off through slogans such as \"Player's Please\", which was registered in 1924.

{"article": "###\nArticle: But new research from Imperial College London suggests the gender gap between men and women's life expectancies is narrowing. It predicts in 2030 men in England and Wales can expect to live on average to 85.7 years - just two years fewer than women. In 1981 on the other hand, men were likely to die six years before women on average. But why does this gender gap exist and will it ever close? In 1909 women tended to outlive men by just 2.5 years, Prof Les Mayhew at Cass Business School says. At this point infections were the most common cause of death and they affected men and women equally in many respects. But most adults were dead by their early fifties - and many lives would have ended much earlier through childhood illness. As living standards improved and antibiotics were developed to help fight off major killers, life expectancy increased. But despite these gains, the gap between men and women began to widen in the second half of the century. Smoking is widely recognised as one of the main reasons behind the gender gap. And quitting is seen by many as the main reason it is now narrowed. Records show men took up tobacco earlier than women and more of them picked up the habit - meaning their epidemic had a greater and long-lasting impact on their life spans. By 1948 estimates suggest 80% of men were using some form of tobacco. Inevitably many died of smoking related ailments such as heart attacks and lung cancer. And this stamped out many of the gains in life expectancy men may otherwise have enjoyed. Women on the other hand took up smoking a generation later on average. But the female habit never reached the same proportions that male smoking did. By the 1960S and 1970s doctors and government officials had started to take the link between tobacco and death more seriously. And gradually smoking rates began to decline. Many of the benefits are being reaped today - and because more men smoked, they now enjoy a greater share in these longevity gains. Prof Sir Richard Peto, from Oxford University says: \"About half of all smokers are killed by tobacco if they continue to smoke. \"But stopping works amazingly well. \"Those who stop before the age of 40 - preferably well before then - avoid more than 90% of the risks.\" Improvements in prevention and treatment of heart disease have contributed too. And others suggest many men are involved in less dangerous jobs now. For example, a million men were employed in dangerous mining in the 1920s putting them at risk of lung disease. Prof Les Mayhew of Cass Business school argues this is unlikely. In a study published last year he says:  \"It would be hard to justify these differences on biological grounds since the gender gap varies so much and is different in each country, and therefore it is more likely to be societal in origin.\" But others say biological differences probably play a part. Projections indicate when comparing non-smoking men and non-smoking women, life expectancy remains higher in women. No one has pinned down exactly what this biological advantage would be, if it exists at all. But experts suggest it could be partly due to hormones protecting women from heart disease. Whatever is protecting women, their advantage over men has been hugely aggravated by smoking patterns, Prof Peto says. Many theories on the male shortfall in life expectancy are still open to debate and yet to be proven definitively. Some studies suggest females enjoy a longer life partly because their immune systems age more slowly. So in older age they are able to fight off illnesses, while men grow more susceptible to disease. Others argue there is an ancient, evolutionary answer to the gap - seen in other species too. One theory  suggests males' competitive natures- arising from a desire to attract mates - encourages them to  engage in more risky and ultimately more fatal behaviours. Others believe women may be needed for longer, to make sure their offspring are well cared for into the future. Official figures show the gap has been closing gradually. And Office of National Statistics estimates put the gap at  around three years by 2037. Prof Mayhew on the other hand, in work published in 2014, estimates men and women could expect to live as long as each other in 2030. But others call that an implausible claim. Predictions are uncertain - many things could change in the years to come. In the tricky world of modelling the future, there is some consensus on at least one thing. Both men and women are likely to continue living longer and according to some - healthier - lives for many years to come.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "It has long been accepted that women outlive men.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It is illegal in most US states, amounting usually to a misdemeanour charge, unless there are serious injuries. There has been a nationwide crackdown on hazing after high-profile deaths including that of Florida A&M University drumming student Robert Champion. Why is hazing so common? Mr Seely was targeted at an off-campus fraternity house, Alpha Chi Rho, which was sanctioned in 2011 for hazing incidents. His mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about the alleged hazing in a viral Facebook post in March, saying: \"He could have been killed.\" The accounting student only told his family what had happened months afterwards. He blamed the incident for his decision to leave the college. The teenager's father, Paul Seely, told CBS News his son could have been killed if the peanut butter had entered his mouth. The Seely family said their son had made known to other members of the fraternity that he had a severe peanut allergy, for which he carries medication. The National Fraternity of Alphi Chi Rho condemned the incident, saying it did not condone such behaviour. \"Alpha Chi Rho is appalled and upset by the actions taken by individuals against Andrew Seely,\" said its statement.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A US student has been charged with smearing peanut butter in the face of an undergraduate who has a potentially deadly allergy.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: A social media campaign had proposed giving Halti mountain summit to Finland for its 100th birthday next year. The border between the two countries runs up the mountain near its peak. But Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said that sadly she had had to turn down the idea because the country's constitution prohibited any sacrifice of Norwegian territory. Part of Halti mountain is already in Finland - and forms its current highest point - but the peak is 20m (66ft) across the border inside Norwegian territory. Campaigners had proposed moving the border to give the summit, at 1,330m (4,363 ft), to Finland, saying the change would be barely visible on the map. They had argued that the peak \"would be a wonderful gift to our sister nation\" to mark its independence from Russia, and not a big loss to mountainous Norway, which has much higher peaks. The campaign's Facebook page got 17,000 likes, with support from both sides of the border. But it hit upon an insurmountable legal issue. \"Border adjustments between countries raise challenging legal problems, among them linked to the Norwegian constitution,\" Ms Solberg wrote to Svein Leiros, the mayor of the town of Kaafjord in northern Norway, who supported the campaign. Norway's  1814 constitution stipulates that the country is \"indivisible\" - and apparently not even an area the size of a football pitch can be split off. \"We will instead consider another suitable gift to Finland on its anniversary,\" the prime minister added.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Norway has rejected a plan to give its neighbour Finland a mountain to mark the centenary of its independence.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The Fraser of Allander Institute reckons that growth this year will be 1.9%, the same as its forecast for last year, for which official data has not been finalised. That is a reduction on the 2.2% forecast for 2016 that it published in November. For 2017, the forecast has fallen from 2.5% to 2.2% in those past four months. The economists at the Strathclyde University institute warned that growth was too dependent on household spending based on credit, which they said was unsustainable. They explained that the benefits of cheaper oil had not fed through to the economy as strongly as the harm it had done to the energy sector itself. The sustained low price was further pulling back on investment plans. The economists argued that this month's Westminster budget should avoid a further squeeze on spending, as tax revenues appeared to fall short of previous expectations. Prof Brian Ashcroft, author of the regular Fraser of Allander reports, said that would slow growth further and worsen the flow of tax revenues to the exchequer. The report said that job creation should continue but forecasted a slower rate of growth. The central forecast for net employment increase was 36,800, whereas in November, it was 45,000. The report also warned of the effect of the UK being taken out of the European Union, following the referendum in June. It claimed the uncertainty about the outcome of the vote would have a negative effect on investment. Its analysis of the European choice was that \"it is difficult to imagine that it would help improve Scotland's competitive position to our trade with the EU\". It noted that the fall in electronics and other manufacturing exports had meant Scotland already found it hard to penetrate open EU markets. The Strathclyde report said Scottish exporters would find it more difficult if the trade arrangements were changed. Also, productivity could be slowed, when it was already relatively weak. The latest report from Fraser of Allander noted that the Scottish economy still benefited from low inflation and low interest rates and earning power had been increasing slowly. However, it reflected on the strength of Sterling, making imports cheaper and exports more difficult. That factor had weakened in recent weeks, though trade had been slowing globally. It said growth had been depending too much on rising and unsustainable household debt. Paul Brewer, a senior partner at PwC which sponsors the Fraser of Allander reports, said: \"The potential for the forthcoming budget to exert further fiscal tightening, oil price uncertainty and the uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome of the EU referendum, together create a difficult environment for business and investor confidence.\" He suggested the UK Chancellor could help the economy with a further cut in tax on oil producers. At sector level, the analysis said the service sector was the driver of growth, although financial services showed little sign of recovery to pre-recession levels. The production sector had contracted in the most recent official data, and construction had ceased to be the driver that it was of Scottish growth.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Growth in the Scottish economy is failing to pick up pace, according to one of Scotland's main forecasters.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: \"Stalled,\" she said, before challenging anyone in the room to name a significant change that had taken place in the last two years. So is she right? Has the much vaunted Burmese reform project ground to a halt? The answer depends on how narrowly you define reform. When she speaks, Ms Suu Kyi is thinking politics. The pace of political change has certainly slowed.  In part that's because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein's presidency. In the Burmese context, \"easy\" means decisions that don't upset the army. Political prisoners were released, censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a (flawed) law passed allowing public demonstrations. In a short period of time, one of the world's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible. Stories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers, and demonstrations, mostly connected to land rights, have become almost daily events. But the early pace of those changes hasn't been sustained. There was no way it could. So did the reformers run out of steam? Did Thein Sein's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army? Or perhaps we're close to the final destination - that is, with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge. Ms Suu Kyi's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged. Drafted in 2008, it entrenches the military's control of political life, guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw (the Burmese parliament), and a veto over any changes to the constitution. This is what its architects proudly call a \"disciplined democracy\". The opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most. They are: the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president, which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power (because of her British sons) and Article 436, which gives the army a veto on constitutional changes. Much of Ms Suu Kyi's annoyance stems from the fact that the legislature that she joined in 2012, and thus legitimised, is now being cynically used to thwart her ambition. Just as it would in mature democracies, responsibility for shaping the constitutional reform process was handed to a series of parliamentary committees. With each committee mirroring the composition of the military-dominated Hluttaw, they've deliberated for months and delivered entirely predictable results. Altering the \"Suu Kyi clause\" has been dismissed outright (as a threat to national sovereignty), while amending Article 436 will be discussed in parliament, though if the army remains opposed there's no way it can be changed. Ms Suu Kyi's slim hopes of taking the top job after the election in 2015 now rest on a backroom deal among senior leaders. Looming in many minds is the possibility of a constitutional crisis this time next year. What if the party that wins the most seats is unable or unwilling to nominate a president? Though the changes that Aung San Suu Kyi wants most have stalled, that's not to say there haven't been other important developments.  It's just that they don't directly involve Ms Suu Kyi. Ever since independence in 1948, Myanmar has never been truly at peace, with minority ethnic groups fighting guerrilla wars against the Burman-dominated state. The last three years has seen real progress towards what would be an unprecedented nationwide ceasefire agreement. All the major rebel groups have been brought into the process, attracted by the promise of dialogue on a more federal future. For President Thein Sein, a peace agreement would be the crowning achievement of what's likely to be his only term in office. Unfortunately for him, with a deal within reach, the number of clashes has begun to increase once more. Outside politics, particularly in the big cities, people's lives are changing fast. Thanks to new laws and regulations, Myanmar's economy and banking sectors are liberalising and opening up to the outside world. GDP growth is rapid, though improvements in living standards still lag a long way behind. On Myanmar's streets two new foreign phone companies are currently battling it out for a lucrative new market. After years in which mobile phones and the internet were government-run and SIM cards the preserve of the elite, there's now the prospect of low-cost data and unrestricted access to information. In itself that's a game-changer. So is the Myanmar reform glass half full or half empty?

{"article": "###\nArticle: It says officers who file complaints are labelled as \"troublemakers\" and pressured to leave the force. A separate, unpublished police report has said disproportionate numbers of minority officers in some forces end up in the disciplinary system. The Association of Chief Police Officers says the data is \"worrying\". Speaking to Radio 4's             File on 4  programme, President of the NBPA Charles Critchlow said: \"I think the worst aspect is it appears that even senior officers are prepared to use instruments within the service, for example the disciplinary process, to put pressure on these officers and ultimately force them out of the organisation and that's something that we're very, very concerned about.\" He added: \"I think there still exists within the police service a pattern of behaviour where officers, particularly junior officers, who make a complaint or challenge inappropriate behaviour - particularly if it's got anything to do with race - seem to be labelled as troublemakers.\" However, Mr Critchlow also stressed: \"That is not to say that all officers are racist or discriminate against people, but there seems to be a problem in the police service when it comes to dealing with race issues.\" The BBC has also seen an internal draft report which shows police disciplinary procedures being used disproportionately against black and Asian officers in some forces. The report was compiled by academic researchers on behalf of Greater Manchester Police and includes data from the West Midlands Police and the British Transport Police. It acknowledges concerns from minority officers about unfair treatment and confirms that in the West Midlands, black and minority ethnic (BME) officers are almost twice as likely to be the subject of an investigation as white officers. Findings for the British Transport Police are broadly similar. The research also looks at officers being kept under surveillance in internal counter-corruption investigations and found that in Greater Manchester the proportion of minority officers being investigated is three times higher than that of white officers.

Contact the File on 4 team In the West Midlands, the rate of allegations of corruption against BME officers is more than five times higher than the rate of allegations against white officers. The authors of the report are calling for further research and say their findings suggest the problems identified are not limited to the three forces featured in the research. Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Police Alfred Hitchcock, who is the Association of Chief Police Officers lead on equality, diversity and human rights, says he has not yet seen the internal report but says the data is \"worrying\". He told the BBC he would be speaking to other chief officers about the matter, but defended the way internal complaints are dealt with. \"If there are matters relating to racist or improper behaviour, then those are investigated and people who are victims are treated as victims. \"The service is very keen to make sure that we deal properly and appropriately with all staff and by doing that we would hope that people see us as being fair with all, and that is the objective,\" he said. File on 4's investigation also uncovered concerns about the slow progress forces have made in recruiting and promoting BME officers. Thirteen years after the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry recommended increased numbers of black and ethnic minority officers, the latest Home Office figures show more BME officers are leaving the police than joining. In 2010-11, 165 BME officers were recruited, but 204 left the service. Mr Hitchcock blames government cuts on police funding which has led to a recruitment freeze and subsequently a dip in numbers, but acknowledges the police leadership must do more: \"If some people think that we've got this sorted I think they're living in a dream world. I think there is an awful lot of work for us still to do. \"There is a danger that we put an over-negative spin on where we've come in the last decade because actually we've made fantastic progress.

Eeyore to the rest of the government's Tiggers, Number 11 is hoping for the best while preparing for the worst. Yes, the chancellor has said to colleagues, the mood has changed since the Autumn Statement. There will certainly be some \"pats on the back\" when it comes to the Budget on Wednesday. The economy is more resilient as consumers - buoyed by ultra-low interest rates, cheap borrowing and high employment - keep spending. And among the members of the European Union there is less talk of economic \"punishment\" as Brexit approaches - and more of \"co-operation\". I am told that one banking chief executive was even bold enough to tell the Prime Minister at a recent private meeting that in three years' time the UK's financial services sector and the economy could be in a better position than they are now. How to follow the Budget on the BBC Better growth also means the government's borrowing position is more positive than predicted just three months ago. Tax receipts are higher as stronger consumer spending and higher levels of business activity feed through to the Exchequer. The Office for Budget Responsibility - the official economic watchdog - is set to upgrade its growth forecast for 2017. And borrowing, it is likely to say, will come in at least \u00a310bn lower than the official target. It should be remembered, however, that that target was significantly loosened last year. So, with a better economic outlook, will the Budget be a time for a few politically targeted giveaways? There will be some limited action. The Treasury was certainly stung by accusations following the Autumn Statement that Philip Hammond did not mention the NHS or social care funding despite predictions of a looming crisis. Expect more money for social care, more money for business rate relief and more money for schools. Individual tax thresholds - the point at which people start paying tax on their income - will also be increased, getting ever closer to the target of \u00a312,500 of tax-free income promised in the Conservatives' 2015 manifesto. But each move will be limited. Yes, the Treasury will have a modicum of borrowing headroom,  but officials have created a long list of headwinds that could knock the economy off course. Eeyore still wonders if an earthquake might strike. First, the tax base is eroding as more people join the \"gig\" economy - the self-employed who work for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo and pay less tax. Gig employers also pay less in national insurance and pension contributions. Mr Hammond wants a review of the tax status of the self-employed, ready for major announcements in the autumn, when the new cycle of November Budgets begins. Treasury officials are also convinced that some of thegood news on increased tax receipts are \"one-offs\" - changes to self-assessment rules and corporation tax payments that will not be repeated. Then there are the fears about the Brexit process, when officials worry that \"good days and bad days\" news coverage will affect economic confidence. Inflation is also on the march, government borrowing costs on its \u00a31.7 trillion debt load are rising and the UK's age-old productivity problem refuses to go away. Mr Hammond and Theresa May are both fiscal conservatives - cleaving strongly to the idea that \"balancing the books\" between what a government receives in taxes and spends on public services is the only way to maintain economic stability and growth. The Prime Minister apparently often interjects in policy committee meetings with the question: \"Where is the money coming from?\" Given that background, better economic news and better borrowing figures are not about to lead to big Budget giveaways. Eeyore just wouldn't countenance it.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "\"We haven't had an earthquake lately,\" was Eeyore's tart response when asked about forecasts that the weather can only improve in the Hundred Acre Wood.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

{"article": "###\nArticle: Presiding officer Tricia Marwick shed tears after veteran Labour MSP Duncan McNeil bid farewell to the parliament. And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber: \"It's goodbye from me... for now\". Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May. Mr Salmond, who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014, used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was \"not divided, but diverse\". He said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added: \"Yes we are a country of different views, but we are not divided. There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland. \"And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that\". He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign. There were lighters moments as Mr Salmond, who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget, joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a \"major attraction down south today\". He then added: \"However, on balance, I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks.\" And the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, \"albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm\". He concluded his address by saying: \"Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament. \"There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland. There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country. \"And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now\". Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had \"served the parliament and Scotland with distinction\". The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999. Mr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system. He said: \"It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary. \"We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences.\" He recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster. But Mr McNeil said: \"It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business.\" Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood. In her speech, she joked she would miss her dealings with Finance Secretary John Swinney, especially \"his huge outbursts of faux indignation\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Former first minister Alex Salmond has made his final speech in the Scottish Parliament amid emotional scenes in the Holyrood chamber.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
{"article": "###\nArticle: The systems, at Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California, are now running normally again. None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom. And the cases are now being investigated by the FBI. The Kentucky Methodist Hospital had to shut down all of its desktop computers and activate a back-up system. A message on its homepage said: \"Methodist Hospital is currently working in an internal state of emergency due to a computer virus that has limited our use of electronic web-based services. \"We are currently working to resolve this issue, until then we will have limited access to web-based services and electronic communications.\" It later said no patient data or care had been affected. Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare Services, which owns Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, said: \"It did cause significant disruptions of our IT systems. \"However, most of the systems and the critical infrastructure has been brought back online.\" The attack comes weeks after it was revealed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre in Los Angeles had been attacked by ransomware. In that case, it paid $17,000 to get access to files back. Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension .locky. The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros \"if the data encoding is incorrect\". Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked. In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016. Security expert Brian Krebs said: \"It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted. \"I also worry that these more deliberate attackers will take a bit more time to discern how much the data they've encrypted is really worth, and precisely how much the victim might be willing to pay to get it back.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The IT systems of three US hospitals have been infected with ransomware, which encrypts vital files and demands money to unlock them.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
